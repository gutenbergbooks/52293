<p>Which was first, Matter or Force?
If we think on this question, we
shall find that we are unable to conceive
of matter without force, or of force without
matter. When God created the elements
of which the earth is composed, He
created certain wondrous forces, which
are set free, and become evident when
matter acts on matter. All these forces,
with many differences, have much in common,
and if one is set free, it will immediately
endeavour to free its companions.
Thus, heat will enable us to eliminate
light, electricity, magnetism, and chemical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
action; chemical action will educe light,
electricity, and heat. In this way we find
that all the forces in nature tend to form
mutually dependent systems; and as the
motion of one star affects another, so force
in action liberates and renders evident
forces previously tranquil.</p>

<p>We say tranquil, and yet the word is
almost without meaning in the Cosmos.&mdash;Where
do we find tranquillity? The sea,
the seat of animal, vegetable, and mineral
changes, is at war with the earth, and the
air lends itself to the strife. The globe,
the scene of perpetual intestine change, is,
as a mass, acting on, and acted on, by the
other planets of our system, and the very
system itself is changing its place in space,
under the influence of a known force
springing from an unknown centre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>For many years the English public
had the privilege of listening to the
discourses and speculations of Professor
Faraday, at the Royal Institution, on
Matter and Forces; and it is not too much
to say that no lecturer on Physical Science,
since the time of Sir Humphrey Davy,
was ever listened to with more delight.
The pleasure which all derived from the
expositions of Faraday was of a somewhat
different kind from that produced by any
other philosopher whose lectures we have
attended. It was partially derived from
his extreme dexterity as an operator: with
him we had no chance of apologies for
an unsuccessful experiment&mdash;no hanging
fire in the midst of a series of brilliant
demonstrations, producing that depressing
tendency akin to the pain felt by an
audience at a false note from a vocalist.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
All was a sparkling stream of eloquence
and experimental illustration. We would
have defied a chemist loving his science,
no matter how often he might himself
have repeated an experiment, to feel
uninterested when seeing it done by
Faraday.</p>

<p>The present publication presents one or
two points of interest. In the first place,
the Lectures were especially intended for
young persons, and are therefore as free
as possible from technicalities; and in the
second place, they are printed as they
were spoken, <i>verbatim et literatim</i>. A
careful and skilful reporter took them
down; and the manuscript, as deciphered
from his notes, was subsequently most
carefully corrected by the Editor as regards
any scientific points which were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
clear to the short-hand writer; hence all
that is different arises solely from the
impossibility, alas! of conveying the manner
as well as the matter of the Lecturer.</p>

<p>May the readers of these Lectures derive
one-tenth of the pleasure and instruction
from their perusal which they gave to
those who had the happiness of hearing
them!</p>

<p>It grieves me much to think that I may
have been a cause of disturbance in your
Christmas arrangements<a id="FNanchor_1_2" href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">1</a>, for nothing is more
satisfactory to my mind than to perform what
I undertake; but such things are not always
left in our own power, and we must submit
to circumstances as they are appointed. I will
to-day do my best, and will ask you to bear
with me if I am unable to give more than a
few words; and as a substitute, I will endeavour
to make the <i>illustrations</i> of the sense I try to
express as full as possible; and if we find by
the end of this lecture that we may be
justified in continuing them, thinking that next
week our power shall be greater,&mdash;why, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
with submission to you, we will take such
course as you may think fit,&mdash;either to go on,
or discontinue them; and although I now
feel much weakened by the pressure of
illness (a mere cold) upon me, both in facility
of expression and clearness of thought, I shall
here claim, as I always have done on these
occasions, the right of addressing myself to
the younger members of the audience. And
for this purpose, therefore, unfitted as it may
seem for an elderly infirm man to do so, I
will return to second childhood and become,
as it were, young again amongst the young.</p>

<p>Let us now consider, for a little while, how
wonderfully we stand upon this world. Here
it is we are born, bred, and live, and yet we
view these things with an almost entire
absence of wonder to ourselves respecting
the way in which all this happens. So
small, indeed, is our wonder, that we are
never taken by surprise; and I do think
that, to a young person of ten, fifteen, or
twenty years of age, perhaps the first sight
of a cataract or a mountain would occasion
him more surprise than he had ever felt con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>cerning
the means of his own existence,&mdash;how
he came here; how he lives; by what
means he stands upright; and through what
means he moves about from place to place.
Hence, we come into this world, we live, and
depart from it, without our thoughts being
called specifically to consider how all this
takes place; and were it not for the exertions
of some few inquiring minds, who have looked
<i>into</i> these things and ascertained the very
beautiful laws and conditions by which we <i>do</i>
live and stand upon the earth, we should
hardly be aware that there was anything
wonderful in it. These inquiries, which have
occupied philosophers from the earliest days,
when they first began to find out the laws by
which we grow, and exist, and enjoy ourselves,
up to the present time, have shewn us that all
this was effected in consequence of the existence
of certain <i>forces</i>, or <i>abilities</i> to do things, or
<i>powers</i>, that are so common that nothing can
be more so; for nothing is commoner than the
wonderful powers by which we are enabled
to stand upright&mdash;they are essential to our
existence every moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>It is my purpose to-day to make you acquainted
with some of these powers; not the
vital ones, but some of the more elementary,
and, what we call, <i>physical</i> powers: and, in the
outset, what can I do to bring to your minds
a notion of neither more nor less than that
which I mean by the word <i>power</i>, or <i>force</i>?
Suppose I take this sheet of paper, and place
it upright on one edge, resting against a support
before me (as the roughest possible illustration
of something to be disturbed), and suppose I
then pull this piece of string which is attached
to it. I pull the paper over. I have therefore
brought into use a <i>power</i> of doing so&mdash;the
<i>power</i> of my hand carried on through this
string in a way which is very remarkable when
we come to analyse it; and it is by means of
these powers conjointly (for there are several
powers here employed) that I pull the paper
over. Again, if I give it a push upon the
other side, I bring into play a <i>power</i>, but a
very different exertion of power from the
former; or, if I take now this bit of shell-lac
[a stick of shell-lac about 12 inches long and
1½ in diameter] and rub it with flannel, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
hold it an inch or so in front of the upper
part of this upright sheet, the paper is immediately
moved towards the shell-lac, and by
now drawing the latter away, the paper falls
over without having been touched by anything.
You see&mdash;in the first illustration I produced an
effect than which nothing could be commoner&mdash;I
pull it over now, not by means of that string
or the pull of my hand, but by some action
in the shell-lac. The shell-lac, therefore, has
a <i>power</i> wherewith it acts upon the sheet of
paper; and as an illustration of the exercise
of another kind of power, I might use gunpowder
with which to throw it over.</p>

<p>Now, I want you to endeavour to comprehend
that when I am speaking of a <i>power</i> or <i>force</i>,
I am speaking of that which I used just now
to pull over this piece of paper. I will not
embarrass you at present with the <i>name</i> of that
power, but it is clear there was a <i>something</i> in
the shell-lac which acted by attraction, and
pulled the paper over; this, then, is one of
those things which we call <i>power</i>, or <i>force</i>; and
you will now be able to recognise it as such
in whatever form I shew it to you. We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
not to suppose that there are so very many
different powers; on the contrary, it is wonderful
to think how few are the powers by which
all the phenomena of nature are governed.
There is an illustration of another kind of
power in that lamp; <i>there</i> is a power of heat&mdash;a
power of doing something, but not the same
power as that which pulled the paper over:
and so, by degrees, we find that there are
certain other powers (not many) in the various
bodies around us. And thus, beginning with the
simplest experiments of pushing and pulling,
I shall gradually proceed to distinguish these
powers one from the other, and compare the
way in which they combine together. This
world upon which we stand (and we have not
much need to travel out of the world for
illustrations of our subject; but the mind of
man is not confined like the matter of his
body, and thus he may and does travel outwards;
for wherever his sight can pierce, there
his observations can penetrate) is pretty nearly
a round globe, having its surface disposed in
a manner of which this terrestrial globe by my
side is a rough model; so much is land and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
so much is water, and by looking at it here
we see in a sort of map or picture how the
world is formed upon its surface. Then, when
we come to examine further, I refer you to
this sectional diagram of the geological strata
of the earth, in which there is a more elaborate
view of what is beneath the surface of our
globe. And when we come to dig into or
examine it (as man does for his own instruction
and advantage, in a variety of ways), we see
that it is made up of different kinds of matter,
subject to a very few powers, and all disposed
in this strange and wonderful way, which gives
to man a history&mdash;and such a history&mdash;as to
what there is in those veins, in those rocks,
the ores, the water springs, the atmosphere
around, and all varieties of material substances,
held together by means of <i>forces</i> in one great
mass, 8,000 miles in diameter, that the mind
is overwhelmed in contemplation of the wonderful
history related by these strata (some
of which are fine and thin like sheets of
paper),&mdash;all formed in succession by the forces
of which I have spoken.</p>

<p>I now shall try to help your attention to what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
I may say by directing, to-day, our thoughts to
one kind of power. You see what I mean by
the term <i>matter</i>&mdash;any of these things that I
can lay hold of with the hand, or in a bag (for
I may take hold of the air by enclosing it in
a bag)&mdash;they are all portions of matter with
which we have to deal at present, generally or
particularly, as I may require to illustrate my
subject. Here is the sort of matter which we
call <i>water</i>,&mdash;it is <i>there</i> ice [pointing to a block
of ice upon the table], <i>there</i> water [pointing
to the water boiling in a flask], <i>here</i> vapour&mdash;you
see it issuing out from the top [of the
flask]. Do not suppose that that ice and that
water are two entirely different things, or that
the steam rising in bubbles and ascending in
vapour <i>there</i> is absolutely different from the
fluid water. It may be different in some particulars,
having reference to the <i>amounts</i> of
power which it contains; but it is the same,
nevertheless, as the great ocean of water around
our globe, and I employ it here for the sake of
illustration, because if we look into it we shall
find that it supplies us with examples of all the
powers to which I shall have to refer. For in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>stance,
here is water&mdash;it is heavy; but let us
examine it with regard to the <i>amount</i> of its
heaviness, or its gravity. I have before me a
little glass vessel and scales [nearly equipoised
scales, one of which contained a half-pint glass
vessel], and the glass vessel is at present the
lighter of the two; but if I now take some
water and pour it in, you see that that side of
the scales immediately goes down; that shews
you (using common language, which I will not
suppose for the present you have hitherto applied
very strictly) that it is <i>heavy</i>: and if I put
this additional weight into the opposite scale,
I should not wonder if this vessel would hold
water enough to weigh <i>it</i> down. [The Lecturer
poured more water into the jar, which again
went down.] Why do I hold the bottle <i>above</i>
the vessel to pour the water into it? You will
say, because experience has taught me that it is
necessary. I do it for a better reason&mdash;because
it is a law of nature that the water should fall
towards the earth, and therefore the very means
which I use to cause the water to enter the
vessel are those which will carry the whole body
of water down. That power is what we call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
<i>gravity</i>, and you see <i>there</i> [pointing to the
scales] a good deal of water gravitating towards
the earth. Now <i>here</i> [exhibiting a small piece
of platinum<a id="FNanchor_2_3" href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">2</a>] is another thing which gravitates
towards the earth as much as the whole of
that water. See what a little there is of it&mdash;<i>that</i>
little thing is heavier than so much water
[placing the metal in opposite scales to the
water]. What a wonderful thing it is to see
that it requires so much water as <i>that</i> [a half-pint
vessel full] to fall towards the earth, compared
with the little mass of substance I have
<i>here</i>! And again, if I take this metal [a bar
of aluminium<a id="FNanchor_3_4" href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">3</a> about eight times the bulk of
the platinum], we find the water will balance
that as well as it did the platinum; so that we
get, even in the very outset, an example of what
we want to understand by the words <i>forces</i> or
<i>powers</i>.</p>

<p>I have spoken of water, and first of all of its
property of falling downwards. You know very
well how the oceans surround the globe&mdash;how
they fall round the surface, giving roundness
to it, clothing it like a garment; but, besides
that, there are other properties of water. <i>Here</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
for instance, is some quick-lime, and if I add
some water to it, you will find another power
or property in the water.<a id="FNanchor_4_5" href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">4</a> It is now very
hot, it is steaming up, and I could perhaps light
phosphorus or a lucifer match with it. Now,
that could not happen without a <i>force</i> in the
water to produce the result; but that force is
entirely distinct from its power of falling to the
earth. Again, here is another substance [some
anhydrous sulphate of copper<a id="FNanchor_5_6" href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">5</a>] which will
illustrate another kind of power. [The Lecturer
here poured some water over the white
sulphate of copper, which immediately became
blue, evolving considerable heat at the same
time.] Here is the same water, with a substance
which heats nearly as much as the lime does;
but see how differently. So great indeed is this
heat in the case of lime, that it is sufficient
sometimes (as you see here) to set wood on fire;
and this explains what we have sometimes
heard, of barges laden with quick-lime taking
fire in the middle of the river, in consequence
of this power of heat brought into play by a
leakage of the water into the barge. You see
how strangely different subjects for our con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>sideration
arise, when we come to think over
these various matters,&mdash;the power of heat
evolved by acting upon lime with water, and
the power which water has of turning this salt
of copper from white to blue.</p>

<p>I want you now to understand the nature
of the most simple exertion of this power of
matter called <i>weight</i>, or <i>gravity</i>. Bodies are
heavy&mdash;you saw that in the case of water when
I placed it in the balance. Here I have what
we call a <i>weight</i> [an iron half cwt.]&mdash;a thing
called a weight, because in it the exercise of
that power of pressing downwards is especially
used for the purposes of weighing; and I have
also one of these little inflated india-rubber
bladders, which are very beautiful although very
common (most beautiful things are common),
and I am going to put the weight upon it, to
give you a sort of illustration of the downward
pressure of the iron, and of the power which
the air possesses of resisting that pressure. It
may burst, but we must try to avoid that
[During the last few observations the Lecturer
had succeeded in placing the half cwt. in a state
of quiescence upon the inflated india-rubber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
ball, which consequently assumed a shape very
much resembling a flat cheese with round edges.]
There you see a bubble of air bearing half a
hundred weight, and you must conceive for
yourselves what a wonderful <i>power</i> there must
be to pull this weight downwards, to sink it
thus in the ball of air.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_001.jpg" width="200" height="215" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>Let me now give you another illustration of
this power. You know what a pendulum is.
I have one here (fig. 1), and if I set it swinging,
it will continue to swing to and fro. Now, I
wonder whether you can tell me why that body
oscillates to and fro&mdash;that pendulum bob as it
is sometimes called. Observe, if I hold the
straight stick horizontally, as high as the position
of the balls at the two ends of its journey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
you see that the ball is in a higher position at
the two extremities than it is when in the
middle. Starting from one end of the stick,
the ball falls towards the centre; and then
rising again to the opposite end, it constantly
tries to fall to the lowest point, swinging and
vibrating most beautifully, and with wonderful
properties in other respects&mdash;the time of its
vibration, and so on&mdash;but concerning which we
will not now trouble ourselves.</p>

<p>If a gold leaf, or piece of thread, or any
other substance, were hung where this ball is,
it would swing to and fro in the same manner,
and in the same time too. Do not be startled
at this statement: I repeat, in the same manner
and in the same time; and you will see by and
by how this is. Now, that power which caused
the water to descend in the balance&mdash;which
made the iron weight press upon and flatten
the bubble of air&mdash;which caused the swinging to
and fro of the pendulum,&mdash;that power is entirely
due to the attraction which there is between
the falling body and the earth. Let us be slow
and careful to comprehend this. It is not that
the earth has any <i>particular</i> attraction towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
bodies which fall to it, but, that <i>all</i> these
bodies possess an attraction, every one towards
the other. It is not that the earth has any
special power which these balls themselves have
not; for just as much power as the earth has
to attract these two balls [dropping two ivory
balls], just so much power have they in proportion
to their bulks to draw themselves one to
the other; and the only reason why they fall
so quickly to the earth is owing to its greater
size. Now, if I were to place these two balls
near together, I should not be able, by the most
delicate arrangement of apparatus, to make you,
or myself, sensible that these balls did attract
one another: and yet we know that such is the
case, because, if instead of taking a small ivory
ball, we take a mountain, and put a ball like
this near it, we find that, owing to the vast size
of the mountain, as compared with the billiard
ball, the latter is drawn slightly towards it;
shewing clearly that an attraction <i>does</i> exist,
just as it did between the shell-lac which I
rubbed and the piece of paper which was overturned
by it.</p>

<p>Now, it is not very easy to make these things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
quite clear at the outset, and I must take care
not to leave anything unexplained as I proceed;
and, therefore, I must make you clearly understand
that all bodies are attracted to the earth,
or, to use a more learned term, <i>gravitate</i>. You
will not mind my using this word; for when I
say that this penny-piece <i>gravitates</i>, I mean
nothing more nor less than that it falls towards
the earth, and if not intercepted, it would go on
falling, falling, until it arrived at what we call
the <i>centre of gravity</i> of the earth, which I will
explain to you by and by.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_002.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>I want you to understand that this property
of gravitation is never lost, that every substance
possesses it, that there is never any change in
the quantity of it; and, first of all, I will take
as illustration a piece of marble. Now this
marble has weight&mdash;as you will see if I put it
in these scales; it weighs the balance down,
and if I take it off, the balance goes back again
and resumes its equilibrium. I can decompose
this marble and change it, in the same manner
as I can change ice into water and water into
steam. I can convert a part of it into <i>its own</i>
steam easily, and shew you that this steam from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the marble has the property of remaining in the
same place at common temperatures, which
<i>water</i>-steam has not. If I add a little liquid to
the marble, and decompose it<a id="FNanchor_6_7" href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">6</a>, I get that
which you see&mdash;[the Lecturer here put several
lumps of marble into a glass jar, and poured
water and then acid over them; the carbonic
acid immediately commenced to escape with
considerable effervescence]&mdash;the appearance of
boiling, which is only the separation of one part
of the marble from another. Now this [marble]
steam, and that [water] steam, and all other
steams <i>gravitate</i>, just like any other substance
does&mdash;they all are attracted the one towards the
other, and all fall towards the earth; and what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
I want you to see is, that <i>this</i> steam gravitates.
I have here (fig. 2) a large vessel placed upon
a balance, and the moment I pour this steam
into it, you see that the steam gravitates. Just
watch the index, and see whether it tilts over
or not. [The Lecturer here poured the carbonic
acid out of the glass in which it was being
generated into the vessel suspended on the
balance, when the gravitation of the carbonic
acid was at once apparent.] Look how it is
going down. How pretty that is! I poured
nothing in but the invisible steam, or vapour,
or gas which came from the marble, but you see
that part of the marble, although it has taken
the shape of air, still gravitates as it did before.
Now, will it weigh down that bit of paper?
[Placing a piece of paper in the opposite scale.]
Yes, more than that; it nearly weighs down
this bit of paper. [Placing another piece of
paper in.] And thus you see that <i>other</i> forms
of matter besides solids and liquids tend to fall
to the earth; and, therefore, you will accept
from me the fact&mdash;that <i>all</i> things gravitate,
whatever may be their form or condition. Now
<i>here</i> is another chemical test which is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
readily applied. [Some of the carbonic acid
was poured from one vessel into another, and
its presence in the latter shewn by introducing
into it a lighted taper, which was immediately
extinguished.] You see from this result also
that it gravitates. All these experiments shew
you that, tried by the balance, tried by pouring
like water from one vessel to another, this
steam, or vapour, or gas, is, like all other things,
attracted to the earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_003_004.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 3. and  Fig. 4.</div>
</div>

<p>There is another point I want in the next
place to draw your attention to. I have here a
quantity of shot; each of these falls separately,
and each has its own gravitating power, as you
perceive when I let them fall loosely on a sheet
of paper. If I put them into a bottle, I collect
them together as one mass; and philosophers
have discovered that there is a certain point in
the middle of the whole collection of shots that
may be considered as the <i>one point</i> in which
all their gravitating power is centred, and that
point they call the <i>centre of gravity</i>: it is not
at all a bad name, and rather a short one&mdash;the
centre of gravity. Now suppose I take a sheet
of pasteboard, or any other thing easily dealt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
with, and run a bradawl through it at one
corner <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> (fig. 3), and Mr. Anderson hold that
up in his hand before us, and I then take a
piece of thread and an ivory ball, and hang
that upon the awl&mdash;then the centre of gravity
of both the pasteboard and the ball and string
are as near as they can get to the centre of
the earth; that is to say, the whole of the
attracting power of the earth is, as it were,
centred in a single point of the cardboard&mdash;and
this point is exactly below the point of
suspension. All I have to do, therefore, is to
draw a line, <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, corresponding with the string,
and we shall find that the centre of gravity is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
somewhere in that line. But where? To find
that out, all we have to do is to take another
place for the awl (fig. 4), hang the plumb-line,
and make the same experiment, and there [at
the point <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>] is the centre of gravity&mdash;there
where the two lines which I have traced cross
each other; and if I take that pasteboard, and
make a hole with the bradawl through it at
that point, you will see that it will be supported
in any position in which it may be placed.
Now, knowing that, what do I do when I try
to stand upon one leg? Do you not see that I
push myself over to the left side, and quietly
take up the right leg, and thus bring some
central point in my body over this left leg.
What is that point which I throw over? You
will know at once that it is the <i>centre of gravity</i>&mdash;that
point in me where the whole gravitating
force of my body is centred, and which I thus
bring in a line over my foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_005_006.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 5. and Fig. 6.</div>
</div>

<p>Here is a toy I happened to see the other
day, which will, I think, serve to illustrate our
subject very well. That toy <i>ought</i> to lie something
in this manner (fig. 5); and would do
so if it were uniform in substance. But you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
see it does not; it will get up again. And now
philosophy comes to our aid; and I am perfectly
sure, without looking inside the figure,
that there is some arrangement by which the
centre of gravity is at the lowest point when
the image is standing upright; and we may be
certain, when I am tilting it over (see fig. 6),
that I am lifting up the centre of gravity (<i>a</i>), and
raising it from the earth. All this is effected by
putting a piece of lead inside the lower part
of the image, and making the base of large curvature;
and there you have the whole secret.
But what will happen if I try to make the
figure stand upon a sharp point? You observe,
I must get that point <i>exactly</i> under the centre
of gravity, or it will fall over thus [endeavouring
unsuccessfully to balance it]; and this you see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
is a difficult matter&mdash;I cannot make it stand
steadily. But if I embarrass this poor old lady
with a world of trouble, and hang this wire
with bullets at each end about her neck, it is
very evident that, owing to there being those
balls of lead hanging down on either side, in
addition to the lead inside, I have lowered the
centre of gravity, and now she will stand upon
this point (fig. 7); and what is more, she proves
the truth of our philosophy by standing sideways.</p>

<p>I remember an experiment which puzzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
me very much when a boy. I read it in a
conjuring book, and this was how the problem
was put to us: “How,” as the book said,
“how to hang a pail of water, by means of
a stick, upon the side of a table” (fig. 8).
Now, I have here a table, a piece of stick,
and a pail, and the proposition is, how can
that pail be hung to the edge of this table?
It is to be done; and can you at all anticipate
what arrangement I shall make to enable me
to succeed? Why, this. I take a stick, and
put it in the pail between the bottom and
the horizontal piece of wood, and thus give
it a stiff handle&mdash;and there it is; and what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
is more, the more water I put into the pail
the better it will hang. It is very true that
before I quite succeeded I had the misfortune
to push the bottoms of several pails out;
but here it is hanging firmly (fig. 9), and you
now see how you can hang up the pail in the
way which the conjuring books require.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">Fig. 9.</div>
</div>

<p>Again, if you are really so inclined (and I do
hope all of you are), you will find a great
deal of philosophy in this [holding up a cork
and a pointed thin stick about a foot long].
Do not refer to your toy-books, and say
you have seen that before. Answer me rather,
if I ask you have you <i>understood</i> it before?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
It is an experiment which appeared very
wonderful to me when I was a boy; I used
to take a piece of cork (and I remember, I
thought at first that it was very important
that it should be cut out in the shape of a
man; but by degrees I got rid of that idea),
and the problem was to balance it on the
point of a stick. Now, you will see I have
only to place two sharp-pointed sticks one
on each side, and give it wings, thus, and
you will find this beautiful condition fulfilled.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_010.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 10.</div>
</div>

<p>We come now to another point:&mdash;All bodies,
whether heavy or light, fall to the earth by
this force which we call gravity. By obser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>vation,
moreover, we see that bodies do not
occupy the same time in falling. I think you
will be able to see that this piece of paper
and that ivory ball fall with different velocities
to the table [dropping them]; and if, again,
I take a feather and an ivory ball, and let
them fall, you see they reach the table or
earth at different times&mdash;that is to say, the
ball falls faster than the feather. Now, that
should not be so, for all bodies do fall
equally fast to the earth. There are one or
two beautiful points included in that statement.
First of all, it is manifest that an ounce,
or a pound, or a ton, or a thousand tons, all
fall equally fast, no one faster than another:
here are two balls of lead, a very light one
and a very heavy one, and you perceive they
both fall to the earth in the same time. Now,
if I were to put into a little bag a number
of these balls sufficient to make up a bulk
equal to the large one, they would also fall
in the same time; for if an avalanche fall from
the mountains, the rocks, snow and ice,
together falling towards the earth, fall with
the same velocity, whatever be their size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>I cannot take a better illustration of this
than that of gold leaf, because it brings before
us the reason of this apparent difference in the
time of the fall. Here is a piece of gold-leaf.
Now, if I take a lump of gold and
this gold-leaf, and let them fall through the
air together, you see that the lump of gold&mdash;the
sovereign, or coin&mdash;will fall much faster
than the gold leaf. But why? They are both
gold, whether sovereign or gold-leaf. Why
should they not fall to the earth with the same
quickness? <i>They would do so</i>, but that the air
around our globe interferes very much where
we have the piece of gold so extended and
enlarged as to offer much obstruction on falling
through it. I will, however, shew you that
gold-leaf <i>does</i> fall as fast when the resistance
of the air is excluded&mdash;for if I take a piece
of gold-leaf and hang it in the centre of a
bottle, so that the gold, and the bottle, and
the air within shall all have an equal chance
of falling, then the gold-leaf will fall as fast
as anything else. And if I suspend the bottle
containing the gold-leaf to a string, and set it
oscillating like a pendulum, I may make it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
vibrate as hard as I please, and the gold-leaf
will not be disturbed, but will swing as steadily
as a piece of iron would do; and I might even
swing it round my head with any degree of
force, and it would remain undisturbed. Or I
can try another kind of experiment:&mdash;if I raise
the gold-leaf in this way [pulling the bottle up
to the ceiling of the theatre by means of a
cord and pulley, and then suddenly letting it
fall to within a few inches of the lecture-table],
and allow it then to fall from the ceiling downwards
(I will put something beneath to catch
it, supposing I should be <i>maladroit</i>), you will
perceive that the gold-leaf is not in the least
disturbed. The resistance of the air having
been avoided, the glass bottle and gold-leaf all
fall exactly in the same time.</p>

<p>Here is another illustration,&mdash;I have hung
a piece of gold-leaf in the upper part of this
long glass vessel, and I have the means, by a
little arrangement at the top, of letting the
gold-leaf loose. Before we let it loose we will
remove the air by means of an air pump,
and while that is being done, let me shew
you another experiment of the same kind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
Take a penny-piece, or a half-crown, and a
round piece of paper a trifle smaller in diameter
than the coin, and try them, side by side, to
see whether they fall at the same time [dropping
them]. You see they do not&mdash;the penny-piece
goes down first. But, now place this paper flat
on the top of the coin, so that it shall not meet
with any resistance from the air, and upon <i>then</i>
dropping them you see they <i>do</i> both fall in
the same time [exhibiting the effect]. I dare
say, if I were to put this piece of gold-leaf,
instead of the paper, on the coin, it would do
as well. It is very difficult to lay the gold-leaf
so flat that the air shall not get under it
and lift it up in falling, and I am rather doubtful
as to the success of this, because the gold-leaf
is puckery; but will risk the experiment.
There they go together! [letting them fall] and
you see at once that they both reach the table
at the same moment.</p>

<p>We have now pumped the air out of the
vessel, and you will perceive that the gold-leaf
will fall as quickly in this vacuum as the coin
does in the air. I am now going to let it loose,
and you must watch to see how rapidly it falls.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
There! [letting the gold loose] there it is, falling
as gold should fall.</p>

<p>I am sorry to see our time for parting is
drawing so near. As we proceed, I intend to
write upon the board behind me certain words,
so as to recall to your minds what we have
already examined&mdash;and I put the word <span class="smcap">Forces</span>
as a heading; and I will then add, beneath, the
names of the special forces according to the
order in which we consider them: and although
I fear that I have not sufficiently pointed out
to you the more important circumstances connected
with this force of <span class="smcap">Gravitation</span>, especially
the law which governs its attraction (for
which, I think, I must take up a little time
at our next meeting), still I will put that word
on the board, and hope you will now remember
that we have in some degree considered the
<i>force of gravitation</i>&mdash;that force which causes
all bodies to attract each other when they are
at sensible distances apart, and tends to draw
them together.</p>

<p>Do me the favour to pay me as much attention
as you did at our last meeting,
and I shall not repent of that which I have
proposed to undertake. It will be impossible
for us to consider the Laws of Nature, and
what they effect, unless we now and then give
our sole attention, so as to obtain a clear idea
upon the subject. Give me now that attention,
and then, I trust, we shall not part without your
knowing something about those Laws, and the
manner in which they act. You recollect, upon
the last occasion, I explained that all bodies
attracted each other, and that this power we
called <i>gravitation</i>. I told you that when we
brought these two bodies [two equal sized
ivory balls suspended by threads] near together,
they attracted each other, and that
we might suppose that the whole power of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
this attraction was exerted between their
respective centres of gravity; and furthermore,
you learned from me, that if, instead of a small
ball, I took a larger one, like <i>that</i> [changing
one of the balls for a much larger one],
there was much more of this attraction exerted;
or, if I made this ball larger and larger,
until, if it were possible, it became as large as
the Earth itself&mdash;or, I might take the Earth
itself as the large ball&mdash;that <i>then</i> the attraction
would become so powerful as to cause them
to rush together in this manner [dropping the
ivory ball]. You sit <i>there</i> upright, and I stand
upright <i>here</i>, because we keep our centres of
gravity properly balanced with respect to the
earth; and I need not tell you that on the
other side of this world the people are standing
and moving about with their feet towards our
feet, in a reversed position as compared with
us, and all by means of this power of gravitation
to the centre of the earth.</p>

<p>I must not, however, leave the subject of
gravitation, without telling you something about
its laws and regularity; and first, as regards its
power with respect to the distance that bodies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
are apart. If I take one of these balls and
place it within an inch of the other, they attract
each other with a certain power. If I hold it
at a greater distance off, they attract with
less power; and if I hold it at a greater distance
still, their attraction is still less. Now this
fact is of the greatest consequence; for, knowing
this law, philosophers have discovered
most wonderful things. You know that there
is a planet, Uranus, revolving round the sun
with us, but eighteen hundred millions of miles
off; and because there is another planet as
far off as three thousand millions of miles,
this law of attraction, or gravitation, still holds
good&mdash;and philosophers actually discovered this
latter planet, Neptune, by reason of the effects
of its attraction at this overwhelming distance.
Now I want you clearly to understand what
this law is. They say (and they are right)
that two bodies attract each other <i>inversely as
the square of the distance</i>&mdash;a sad jumble of
words until you understand them; but I think
we shall soon comprehend what this law is,
and what is the meaning of the “inverse square
of the distance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_011.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 11.</div>
</div>

<p>I have here (fig. 11) a lamp <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, shining most
intensely upon this disc, <span class="smcap lowercase">B, C, D</span>; and this light
acts as a sun by which I can get a shadow from
this little screen, <span class="smcap lowercase">B F</span> (merely a square piece of
card), which, as you know, when I place it close
to the large screen, just shadows as much of
it as is exactly equal to its own size. But now
let me take this card <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, which is equal to the
other one in size, and place it midway between
the lamp and the screen: now look at the size
of the shadow <span class="smcap lowercase">B D</span>&mdash;it is four times the original
size. Here, then, comes the “inverse square of
the distance.” This distance, <span class="smcap lowercase">A E</span>, is <i>one</i>, and
that distance, <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>, is <i>two</i>; but that size <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
<i>one</i>, this size <span class="smcap lowercase">B D</span> of shadow is <i>four</i> instead of
<i>two</i>, which is the <i>square</i> of the distance; and,
if I put the screen at one-third of the distance
from the lamp, the shadow on the large screen
would be <i>nine</i> times the size. Again, if I hold
this screen <i>here</i>, at <span class="smcap">B F</span>, a certain amount of
light falls on it; and if I hold it nearer the
lamp at <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, <i>more</i> light shines upon it. And
you see at once how much&mdash;exactly the quantity
which I have shut off from the part of this
screen, <span class="smcap lowercase">B D</span>, now in shadow; moreover, you see
that if I put a single screen here, at <span class="smcap lowercase">G</span>, by the
side of the shadow, it can only receive <i>one-fourth</i>
of the proportion of light which is
obstructed. That, then, is what is meant by
the <i>inverse</i> of the square of the distance. This
screen <span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> is the brightest, because it is the
nearest; and there is the whole secret of this
curious expression, <i>inversely as the square of the
distance</i>. Now, if you cannot perfectly recollect
this when you go home, get a candle and throw
a shadow of something&mdash;your profile, if you like&mdash;on
the wall, and then recede or advance, and
you will find that your shadow is exactly in
proportion to the <i>square</i> of the distance you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
are off the wall; and then if you consider how
much light shines on you at one distance, and
how much at another, you get the inverse
accordingly. So it is as regards the attraction
of these two balls&mdash;they attract according to
the square of the distance, inversely. I want
you to try and remember these words, and then
you will be able to go into all the calculations
of astronomers as to the planets and other
bodies, and tell why they move so fast, and
why they go <i>round</i> the sun without falling into
it, and be prepared to enter upon many other
interesting inquiries of the like nature.</p>

<p>Let us now leave this subject which I have
written upon the board under the word <span class="smcap">Force</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gravitation</span>&mdash;and
go a step further. All
bodies attract each other at sensible distances.
I shewed you the electric attraction on the last
occasion (though I did not call it so); that
attracts at a distance: and in order to make
our progress a little more gradual, suppose I
take a few iron particles [dropping some small
fragments of iron on the table]. There, I have
already told you that in all cases where bodies
fall, it is the <i>particles</i> that are attracted. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
may consider these then as separate particles
magnified, so as to be evident to your sight;
they are loose from each other&mdash;they all gravitate&mdash;they
all fall to the earth&mdash;for the force
of gravitation <i>never</i> fails. Now, I have here
a centre of power which I will not name at
present, and when these particles are placed
upon it, see what an attraction they have for
each other.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_012.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 12.</div>
</div>

<p>Here I have an arch of iron filings (fig. 12)
regularly built up like an iron bridge, because
I have put them within a sphere of action which
will cause them to attract each other. See!&mdash;I
could let a mouse run through it, and yet if I
try to do the same thing with them <i>here</i> [on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
the table], they do not attract each other at all.
It is <i>that</i> [the magnet] which makes them hold
together. Now, just as these iron particles hold
together in the form of an elliptical bridge, so
do the different particles of iron which constitute
this nail hold together and make it one.
And here is a bar of iron&mdash;why, it is only
because the different parts of <i>this</i> iron are so
wrought as to keep close together by the attraction
<i>between</i> the particles that it is held together
in one mass. It is kept together, in fact, merely
by the attraction of one particle to another, and
that is the point I want now to illustrate. If I
take a piece of flint and strike it with a hammer,
and break it thus [breaking off a piece of the
flint], I have done nothing more than separate
the particles which compose these two pieces so
far apart, that their attraction is too weak to
cause them to hold together, and it is only for
that reason that there are now two pieces in the
place of one. I will shew you an experiment
to prove that this attraction does still exist in
those particles, for here is a piece of glass (for
what was true of the flint and the bar of iron
is true of the piece of glass, and is true of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
every other solid&mdash;they are all held together in
the lump by the attraction between their parts),
and I can shew you the attraction between its
separate particles; for if I take these portions
of glass, which I have reduced to very fine
powder, you see that I can actually build them
up into a solid wall by pressure between two
flat surfaces. The power which I thus have
of building up this wall is due to the attraction
of the particles, forming as it were the
cement which holds them together; and so in
this case, where I have taken no very great
pains to bring the particles together, you see
perhaps a couple of ounces of finely-pounded
glass standing as an upright wall. Is not this
attraction most wonderful? <i>That</i> bar of iron
one inch square has such power of attraction
in its particles&mdash;giving to it such strength&mdash;that
it will hold up twenty tons weight before
the little set of particles in the small space,
equal to one division across which it can be
pulled apart, will separate. In this manner
suspension bridges and chains are held together
by the attraction of their particles; and I am
going to make an experiment which will shew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
how strong is this attraction of the particles.
[The Lecturer here placed his foot on a loop
of wire fastened to a support above, and swung
with his whole weight resting upon it for some
moments.] You see while hanging here all
my weight is supported by these little particles
of the wire, just as in pantomimes they sometimes
suspend gentlemen and damsels.</p>

<p>How can we make this attraction of the particles
a little more simple? There are many
things which if brought together properly will
shew this attraction. Here is a boy’s experiment
(and I like a boy’s experiment). Get a
tobacco-pipe, fill it with lead, melt it, and then
pour it out upon a stone, and thus get a clean
piece of lead (this is a better plan than scraping
it&mdash;scraping alters the condition of the surface
of the lead). I have here some pieces of lead
which I melted this morning for the sake of
making them clean. Now these pieces of lead
hang together by the attraction of their particles;
and if I press these two separate pieces
close together, so as to bring their particles
within the sphere of attraction, you will see how
soon they become one. I have merely to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
them a good squeeze, and draw the upper piece
slightly round at the same time, and here they
are as one, and all the bending and twisting
I can give them will not separate them again:
I have joined the lead together, not with solder,
but simply by means of the attraction of the
particles.</p>

<p>This, however, is not the best way of bringing
those particles together&mdash;we have many better
plans than that; and I will shew you one that
will do very well for juvenile experiments.
There is some alum crystallised very beautifully
by nature (for all things are far more beautiful
in their natural than their artificial form), and
here I have some of the same alum broken into
fine powder. In it I have destroyed that force
of which I have placed the name on this board&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cohesion</span>,
or the attraction exerted between
the particles of bodies to hold them together.
Now I am going to shew you that if we take
this powdered alum and some hot water, and
mix them together, I shall dissolve the alum&mdash;all
the particles will be separated by the water
far more completely than they are here in the
powder; but then, being in the water, they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
have the opportunity as it cools (for that is
the condition which favours their coalescence)
of uniting together again and forming one
mass.<a id="FNanchor_7_8" href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Now, having brought the alum into solution,
I will pour it into this glass basin, and you will,
to-morrow, find that those particles of alum
which I have put into the water, and so separated
that they are no longer solid, will, as the water
cools, come together and cohere, and by to-morrow
morning we shall have a great deal of
the alum crystallised out&mdash;that is to say, come
back to the solid form. [The Lecturer here
poured a little of the hot solution of alum into
the glass dish, and when the latter had thus
been made warm, the remainder of the solution
was added.] I am now doing that which I advise
you to do if you use a glass vessel, namely,
warming it slowly and gradually; and in repeating
this experiment, do as I do&mdash;pour the liquid
out gently, leaving all the dirt behind in the
basin: and remember that the more carefully
and quietly you make this experiment at home,
the better the crystals. To-morrow you will
see the particles of alum drawn together; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
if I put two pieces of coke in some part of the
solution (the coke ought first to be washed very
clean, and dried), you will find to-morrow that
we shall have a beautiful crystallisation over
the coke, making it exactly resemble a natural
mineral.</p>

<p>Now, how curiously our ideas expand by
watching these conditions of the attraction of
cohesion!&mdash;how many new phenomena it gives
us beyond those of the attraction of gravitation!
See how it gives us great strength. The things
we deal with in building up the structures on
the earth are of strength (we use iron, stone,
and other things of great strength); and only
think that all those structures you have about
you&mdash;think of the “Great Eastern,” if you please,
which is of such size and power as to be almost
more than man can manage&mdash;are the result of
this power of cohesion and attraction.</p>

<p>I have here a body in which I believe you
will see a change taking place in its condition
of cohesion at the moment it is made. It is at
first yellow, it then becomes a fine crimson red.
Just watch when I pour these two liquids
together&mdash;both colourless as water. [The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Lecturer here mixed together solutions of perchloride
of mercury and iodide of potassium,
when a yellow precipitate of biniodide of mercury
fell down, which almost immediately became
crimson red.] Now, there is a substance which
is very beautiful, but see how it is changing
colour. It was reddish-yellow at first, but it
has now become red.<a id="FNanchor_8_9" href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">8</a> I have previously prepared
a little of this red substance, which you see
formed in the liquid, and have put some of it
upon paper. [Exhibiting several sheets of paper
coated with scarlet biniodide of mercury.<a id="FNanchor_9_10" href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">9</a>]
There it is&mdash;the same substance spread upon
paper; and there, too, is the same substance; and
here is some more of it [exhibiting a piece of
paper as large as the other sheets, but having
only very little red colour on it, the greater
part being yellow], a <i>little</i> more of it, you will
say. Do not be mistaken; there is as much
upon the surface of one of these pieces of paper
as upon the other. What you see yellow is
the same thing as the red body, only the attraction
of cohesion is in a certain degree changed;
for I will take this red body, and apply heat to
it (you may perhaps see a little smoke arise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
but that is of no consequence), and if you look
at it, it will first of all darken&mdash;but see, how it
is becoming yellow. I have now made it all
yellow, and what is more, it will remain so; but
if I take any hard substance, and rub the yellow
part with it, it will immediately go back again
to the red condition. [Exhibiting the experiment.]
There it is. You see the red is not
<i>put back</i>, but <i>brought back</i> by the change in
the substance. Now [warming it over the spirit
lamp] here it is becoming yellow again, and
that is all because its attraction of cohesion
is changed. And what will you say to me
when I tell you that this piece of common charcoal
is just the same thing, only differently
calesced, as the diamonds which you wear?
(I have put a specimen outside of a piece of
straw which was charred in a particular way&mdash;it
is just like black lead.) Now, this charred
straw, this charcoal, and these diamonds, are
all of them the same substance, changed but
in their properties as respects the force of
cohesion.</p>

<p>Here is a piece of glass [producing a piece of
plate-glass about two inches square]&mdash;(I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
want this afterwards to look to and examine
its internal condition)&mdash;and here is some of the
same sort of glass differing only in its power of
cohesion, because while yet melted it has been
dropped into cold water [exhibiting a “Prince
Rupert’s drop”.<a id="FNanchor_10_11" href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">10</a> (fig. 13)];
and if I take one
of these little tear-like pieces and break off
ever so little from the point, the whole will at
once burst and fall to pieces. I will now break
off a piece of this. [The Lecturer nipped off a
small piece from the end of one of the Rupert’s
drops, whereupon the whole immediately fell
to pieces.] There! you see the solid glass has
suddenly become powder&mdash;and more than that,
it has knocked a hole in the glass vessel in
which it was held. I can shew the effect
better in this bottle of water; and it is very
likely the whole bottle will go. [A 6-oz. vial
was filled with water, and a Rupert’s drop
placed in it, with the point of the tail just projecting
out; upon breaking the tip off, the drop
burst, and the shock being transmitted through
the water to the sides of the bottle, shattered
the latter to pieces.]</p>

<p>Here is another form of the same kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
experiment. I have here some more glass which
has not been annealed [showing some thick
glass vessels<a id="FNanchor_11_12" href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">11</a> (fig. 14)], and if I take one of
these glass vessels and drop a piece of pounded
glass into it (or I will take some of these small
pieces of rock crystal&mdash;they have the advantage
of being harder than glass), and so make the
least scratch upon the inside, the whole bottle
will break to pieces,&mdash;it cannot hold together.
[The Lecturer here dropped a small fragment
of rock crystal into one of these glass vessels,
when the bottom immediately came out and fell
upon the plate.] There! it goes through, just as
it would through a sieve.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_013_014.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 13. and Fig. 14.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, I have shewn you these things for the
purpose of bringing your minds to see that
bodies are not merely held together by this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
power of cohesion, but that they are held together
in very curious ways. And suppose I
take some things that are held together by this
force, and examine them more minutely. I
will first take a bit of glass, and if I give it
a blow with a hammer, I shall just break it to
pieces. You saw how it was in the case of the
flint when I broke the piece off; a piece of a
similar kind would come off, just as you would
expect; and if I were to break it up still more,
it would be as you have seen, simply a collection
of small particles of no definite shape or
form. But supposing I take some other thing,
this stone for instance (fig. 15) [taking a piece
of mica<a id="FNanchor_12_13" href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">12</a>], and if I hammer this stone, I may
batter it a great deal before I can break it
up. I may even bend it without breaking it;
that is to say, I may bend it in <i>one particular
direction</i> without breaking it much, although I
feel in my hands that I am doing it some injury.
But now, if I take it by the edges, I find
that it breaks up into leaf after leaf in a most
extraordinary manner. Why should it break up
like that? Not because all stones do, or all
crystals; for there is some salt (fig. 16)&mdash;you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
know what common salt is<a id="FNanchor_13_14" href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">13</a>: here is a piece
of this salt which by natural circumstances has
had its particles so brought together that they
have been allowed free opportunity of combining
or coalescing; and you shall see what
happens if I take this piece of salt and break
it. It does not break as flint did, or as the
mica did, but with a clean sharp angle and exact
surfaces, beautiful and glittering as diamonds
[breaking it by gentle blows with a hammer];
there is a square prism which I may break
up into a square cube. You see these fragments
are all square&mdash;one side may be longer
than the other, but they will only split up so as
to form square or oblong pieces with cubical
sides. Now, I go a little further, and I find
another stone (fig. 17) [Iceland, or calc-spar]<a id="FNanchor_14_15" href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">14</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
which I may break in a similar way, but <i>not</i>
with the same result. Here is a piece which I
have broken off, and you see there are plain
surfaces perfectly regular with respect to each
other; but it is not cubical&mdash;it is what we call
a rhomboid. It still breaks in three directions
most beautifully and regularly, with polished
surfaces, but with <i>sloping</i> sides, not like the
salt. Why not? It is very manifest that this
is owing to the attraction of the particles, one
for the other, being less in the direction in
which they give way than in other directions.
I have on the table before me a number of
little bits of calcareous spar, and I recommend
each of you to take a piece home, and then
you can take a knife and try to divide it in the
direction of any of the surfaces already existing.
You will be able to do it at once; but if you
try to cut it <i>across</i> the crystals, you cannot&mdash;by
hammering, you may bruise and break it up&mdash;but
you can only divide it into these beautiful
little rhomboids.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 15., Fig. 16. and Fig. 17.</div>
</div>

<p>Now I want you to understand a little more
how this is&mdash;and for this purpose I am going
to use the electric light again. You see, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
cannot look into the <i>middle</i> of a body like this
piece of glass. We perceive the outside form,
and the inside form, and we look <i>through</i> it;
but we cannot well find out how these forms
become so: and I want you, therefore, to take
a lesson in the way in which we use a ray of
light for the purpose of seeing what is in the
interior of bodies. Light is a thing which is,
so to say, attracted by every substance that
gravitates (and we do not know anything that
does not). All matter affects light more or
less by what we may consider as a kind of
attraction, and I have arranged (fig. 18) a very
simple experiment upon the floor of the room
for the purpose of illustrating this. I have put
into that basin a few things which those who
are in the body of the theatre will not be able
to see, and I am going to make use of this
power, which matter possesses, of attracting a
ray of light. If Mr. Anderson pours some
water, gently and steadily, into the basin, the
water will attract the rays of light downwards,
and the piece of silver and the sealing-wax
will appear to rise up into the sight of those
who were before not high enough to see over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
the side of the basin to its bottom. [Mr. Anderson
here poured water into the basin, and upon
the Lecturer asking whether any body could
see the silver and sealing-wax, he was answered
by a general affirmative.] Now, I suppose that
everybody can see that they are not at all disturbed,
whilst from the way they appear to have
risen up, you would imagine the bottom of the
basin and the articles in it were two inches
thick, although they are only one of our small
silver dishes and a piece of sealing-wax which
I have put there. The light which now goes
to you from that piece of silver was obstructed
by the edge of the basin, when there was no
water there, and you were unable to see anything
of it; but when we poured in water, the
rays were attracted down by it, over the edge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
of the basin, and you were thus enabled to see
the articles at the bottom.</p>

<p>I have shewn you this experiment first, so
that you might understand how glass attracts
light, and might then see how other substances,
like rock-salt and calcareous spar, mica, and
other stones, would affect the light; and, if
Dr. Tyndall will be good enough to let us use
his light again, we will first of all shew you
how it may be bent by a piece of glass (fig. 19).
[The electric lamp was again lit, and the beam
of parallel rays of light which it emitted was
bent about and decomposed by means of the
prism.] Now, here you see, if I send the
light through this piece of plain glass, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, it
goes straight through, without being bent,
unless the glass be held obliquely, and then
the phenomenon becomes more complicated;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
but if I take this piece of glass, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> [a prism],
you see it will shew a very different effect. It
no longer goes to that wall, but it is bent to
this screen, <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>; and how much more beautiful it
is now [throwing the prismatic spectrum on the
screen]. This ray of light is bent out of its
course by the attraction of the glass upon it.
And you see I can turn and twist the rays to
and fro, in different parts of the room, just as
I please. Now it goes there, now here. [The
Lecturer projected the prismatic spectrum about
the theatre.] Here I have the rays once more
bent on to the screen, and you see how wonderfully
and beautifully that piece of glass not
only bends the light by virtue of its attraction,
but actually splits it up into different colours.
Now, I want you to understand that this piece
of glass [the prism] being perfectly uniform in
its internal structure, tells us about the action
of these other bodies which are not uniform&mdash;which
do not merely <i>cohere</i>, but also have
within them, in different parts, different <i>degrees
of cohesion</i>, and thus attract and bend the light
with varying powers. We will now let the
light pass through one or two of these things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
which I just now shewed you broke so
curiously; and, first of all, I will take a
piece of mica. Here, you see, is our ray of
light. We have first to make it what we call
<i>polarised</i>; but about that you need not trouble
yourselves&mdash;it is only to make our illustration
more clear. Here, then, we have our polarised
ray of light, and I can so adjust it as to make
the screen upon which it is shining either
light or dark, although I have nothing in the
course of this ray of light but what is perfectly
transparent [turning the <i>analyser</i> round]. I
will now make it so that it is quite dark; and
we will, in the first instance, put a piece of
common glass into the polarised ray, so as to
shew you that it does not enable the light to
get through. You see the screen remains
dark. The glass then, internally, has no effect
upon the light. [The glass was removed, and
a piece of mica introduced.] Now, there is the
mica which we split up so curiously into leaf
after leaf, and see how that enables the light
to pass through to the screen, and how, as
Dr. Tyndall turns it round in his hand, you
have those different colours, pink, and purple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
and green, coming and going most beautifully&mdash;not
that the mica is more transparent than
the glass, but because of the different manner
in which its particles are arranged by the force
of cohesion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_020.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 20.</div>
</div>

<p>Now we will see how calcareous spar acts
upon this light,&mdash;that stone which split up
into rhombs, and of which you are each of
you going to take a little piece home. [The
mica was removed, and a piece of calc-spar
introduced at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>.] See how that turns the light
round and round, and produces these rings and
that black cross (fig. 20). Look at those
colours&mdash;are they not most beautiful for you
and for me?&mdash;for I enjoy these things as much
as you do. In what a wonderful manner they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
open out to us the internal arrangement of the
particles of this calcareous spar by the force of
cohesion.</p>

<p>And now I will shew you another experiment.
Here is that piece of glass which before
had no action upon the light. You shall see
what it will do when we apply pressure to it.
Here, then, we have our ray of polarised light,
and I will first of all shew you that the glass
has no effect upon it in its ordinary state,&mdash;when
I place it in the course of the light, the
screen still remains dark. Now, Dr. Tyndall
will press that bit of glass between three little
points, one point against two, so as to bring a
strain upon the parts, and you will see what
a curious effect that has. [Upon the screen
two white dots gradually appeared.] Ah! these
points shew the position of the strain&mdash;in these
parts the force of cohesion is being exerted in
a different degree to what it is in the other
parts, and hence it allows the light to pass
through. How beautiful that is&mdash;how it makes
the light come through some parts, and leaves
it dark in others, and all because we weaken the
force of cohesion between particle and particle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Whether you have this mechanical power of
straining, or whether we take other means, we
get the same result; and, indeed, I will shew
you by another experiment that if we heat the
glass in one part, it will alter its internal structure,
and produce a similar effect. Here is a
piece of common glass, and if I insert this in
the path of the polarised ray, I believe it will
do nothing. There is the common glass [introducing
it]&mdash;no light passes through&mdash;the screen
remains quite dark; but I am going to warm
this glass in the lamp, and you know yourselves
that when you pour warm water upon glass you
put a strain upon it sufficient to break it sometimes&mdash;something
like there was in the case
of the Prince Rupert’s drops. [The glass was
warmed in the spirit-lamp, and again placed
across the ray of light.] Now you see how
beautifully the light goes through those parts
which are hot, making dark and light lines
just as the crystal did, and all because of the
alteration I have effected in its internal condition;
for these dark and light parts are a proof
of the presence of forces acting and dragging
in different directions within the solid mass.</p>

<h2 title="COHESION&mdash;CHEMICAL AFFINITY.">LECTURE III.<br />

<small>COHESION&mdash;CHEMICAL AFFINITY.</small></h2>


<p>We will first return for a few minutes to
one of the experiments made yesterday.
You remember what we put together on that
occasion&mdash;powdered alum and warm water;
here is one of the basins then used. Nothing
has been done to it since; but you will find on
examining it, that it no longer contains any
powder, but a multitude of beautiful crystals.
Here also are the pieces of coke which I put
into the other basin&mdash;they have a fine mass of
crystals about them. That other basin I will
leave as it is. I will not pour the water from it,
because it will shew you that the particles of
alum have done something more than merely
crystallise together. They have pushed the
dirty matter from them, laying it around the
outside or outer edge of the lower crystals&mdash;squeezed
out as it were by the strong attrac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>tion
which the particles of alum have for each
other.</p>

<p>And now for another experiment. We have
already gained a knowledge of the manner in
which the particles of bodies&mdash;of solid bodies&mdash;attract
each other, and we have learnt that
it makes calcareous spar, alum, and so forth,
crystallise in these regular forms. Now, let me
gradually lead your minds to a knowledge of
the means we possess of making this attraction
alter a little in its force; either of increasing,
or diminishing, or apparently of destroying it
altogether. I will take this piece of iron [a
rod of iron about two feet long, and a quarter
of an inch in diameter], it has at present a
great deal of strength, due to its attraction of
cohesion; but if Mr. Anderson will make part
of this red-hot in the fire, we shall then find
that it will become soft, just as sealing-wax will
when heated, and we shall also find that the
more it is heated the softer it becomes. Ah!
but what does <i>soft</i> mean? Why, that the
attraction between the particles is so weakened
that it is no longer sufficient to resist the
power we bring to bear upon it. [Mr. Anderson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
handed to the Lecturer the iron rod, with one
end red-hot, which he shewed could be easily
twisted about with a pair of pliers.] You see,
I now find no difficulty in bending this end
about as I like; whereas I cannot bend the
cold part at all. And you know how the
smith takes a piece of iron and heats it, in
order to render it soft for his purpose: he acts
upon our principle of lessening the adhesion
of the particles, although he is not exactly
acquainted with the terms by which we express
it.</p>

<p>And now we have another point to examine;
and this water is again a very good substance to
take as an illustration (as philosophers we call
it all water, even though it be in the form of
ice or steam). Why is this water hard? [pointing
to a block of ice] because the attraction of
the particles to each other is sufficient to make
them retain their places in opposition to force
applied to it. But what happens when we
make the ice warm? Why, in that case we
diminish to such a large extent the power of
attraction that the solid substance is destroyed
altogether. Let me illustrate this: I will take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
a red-hot ball of iron [Mr. Anderson, by means
of a pair of tongs, handed to the Lecturer a red-hot
ball of iron, about two inches in diameter],
because it will serve as a convenient source of
heat [placing the red-hot iron in the centre of
the block of ice]. You see I am now melting
the ice where the iron touches it. You see the
iron sinking into it, and while part of the solid
water is becoming liquid, the heat of the ball
is rapidly going off. A certain part of the
water is actually rising in steam&mdash;the attraction
of some of the particles is so much diminished
that they cannot even hold together in the
liquid form, but escape as vapour. At the
same time, you see I cannot melt all this ice
by the heat contained in this ball. In the
course of a very short time I shall find it will
have become quite cold.</p>

<p>Here is the water which we have produced
by destroying some of the attraction which
existed between the particles of the ice,&mdash;for
below a certain temperature the particles of
water increase in their mutual attraction, and
become ice; and above a certain temperature
the attraction decreases, and the water becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
steam. And exactly the same thing happens
with platinum, and nearly every substance in
nature; if the temperature is increased to a
certain point, it becomes liquid, and a further
increase converts it into a gas. Is it not a
glorious thing for us to look at the sea, the
rivers, and so forth, and to know that this same
body in the northern regions is all solid ice and
icebergs, while here, in a warmer climate, it has
its attraction of cohesion so much diminished
as to be liquid water. Well, in diminishing
this force of attraction between the particles of
ice, we made use of another force, namely, that
of <i>heat</i>; and I want you now to understand that
this force of heat is always concerned when
water passes from the solid to the liquid state.
If I melt ice in <i>other</i> ways, I cannot do without
heat (for we have the means of making ice
liquid without heat; that is to say, without
using heat as a <i>direct</i> cause). Suppose, for
illustration, I make a vessel out of this piece of
tinfoil [bending the foil up into the shape of
a dish]. I am making it metallic, because I
want the heat which I am about to deal with
to pass readily through it; and I am going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
to pour a little water on this board, and then
place the tin vessel on it. Now if I put some
of this ice into the metal dish, and then proceed
to make it liquid by any of the various
means we have at our command, it still must
take the necessary quantity of heat from something,
and in this case it will take the heat from
the tray, and from the water underneath, and
from the other things round about. Well, a
little salt added to the ice has the power of
causing it to melt, and we shall very shortly see
the mixture become quite fluid, and you will
then find that the water beneath will be frozen&mdash;frozen,
because it has been forced to give up
that heat which is necessary to keep it in the
liquid state, to the ice on becoming liquid. I
remember once, when I was a boy, hearing of
a trick in a country alehouse; the point was
how to melt ice in a quart-pot by the fire, and
freeze it to the stool. Well, the way they did
it was this: they put some pounded ice in a
pewter pot and added some salt to it, and the
consequence was, that when the salt was mixed
with it, the ice in the pot melted (they did
not tell me anything about the salt, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
set the pot by the fire, just to make the result
more mysterious), and in a short time the pot
and the stool were frozen together, as we shall
very shortly find it to be the case here. And
all because salt has the power of lessening the
attraction between the particles of ice. Here
you see the tin dish is frozen to the board&mdash;I
can even lift this little stool up by it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_021.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 21.</div>
</div>

<p>This experiment cannot, I think, fail to impress
upon your minds the fact, that whenever
a solid body loses some of that force of attraction
by means of which it remains solid, heat is
absorbed; and if, on the other hand, we convert
a liquid into a solid, <i>e.g.</i>, water into ice, a corresponding
amount of heat is given out. I
have an experiment shewing this to be the case.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Here (fig. 21) is a bulb, <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, filled with air, the
tube from which dips into some coloured liquid
in the vessel <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>. And I dare say you know
that if I put my hand on the bulb <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, and warm
it, the coloured liquid which is now standing
in the tube at <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span> will travel forward. Now we
have discovered a means, by great care and
research into the properties of various bodies,
of preparing a solution of a salt<a id="FNanchor_15_16" href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">15</a> which, if
shaken or disturbed, will at once become a
solid; and as I explained to you just now (for
what is true of water is true of every other
liquid), by reason of its becoming solid, heat is
evolved, and I can make this evident to you
by pouring it over this bulb;&mdash;there! it is becoming
solid, and look at the coloured liquid,
how it is being driven down the tube, and how
it is bubbling out through the water at the
end; and so we learn this beautiful law of our
philosophy, that whenever we diminish the
attraction of cohesion, we absorb heat&mdash;and
whenever we increase that attraction, heat is
evolved. This, then, is a great step in advance,
for you have learned a great deal in addition
to the mere circumstance that particles attract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
each other. But you must not now suppose that
because they are liquid they have lost their
attraction of cohesion; for here is the fluid
mercury, and if I pour it from one vessel into
another, I find that it will form a stream from
the bottle down to the glass&mdash;a continuous rod
of fluid mercury, the particles of which have
attraction sufficient to make them hold together
all the way through the air down to the glass
itself; and if I pour water quietly from a jug,
I can cause it to run in a continuous stream
in the same manner. Again, let me put a little
water on this piece of plate-glass, and then
take another plate of glass and put it on the
water; there! the upper plate is quite free to
move, gliding about on the lower one from side
to side; and yet, if I take hold of the upper
plate and lift it up straight, the cohesion is so
great that the lower one is held up by it. See
how it runs about as I move the upper one! and
this is all owing to the strong attraction of the
particles of the water. Let me shew you
another experiment. If I take a little soap and
water&mdash;not that the soap makes the particles
of the water more adhesive one for the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
but it certainly has the power of continuing in
a better manner the attraction of the particles
(and let me advise you, when about to experiment
with soap-bubbles, to take care to have
everything clean and soapy). I will now blow
a bubble; and that I may be able to talk and
blow a bubble too, I will take a plate with a
little of the soapsuds in it, and will just soap
the edges of the pipe, and blow a bubble on to
the plate. Now, there is our bubble. Why
does it hold together in this manner? Why,
because the water of which it is composed has
an attraction of particle for particle,&mdash;so great,
indeed, that it gives to this bubble the very
power of an india-rubber ball; for you see, if I
introduce one end of this glass tube into the
bubble, that it has the power of contracting so
powerfully as to force enough air through the
tube to blow out a light (fig. 22)&mdash;the light is
blown out. And look! see how the bubble is
disappearing, see how it is getting smaller and
smaller.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_022_023.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 22. and Fig. 23.</div>
</div>

<p>There are twenty other experiments I might
shew you to illustrate this power of cohesion of
the particles of liquids. For instance, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
would you propose to me if, having lost the
stopper out of this alcohol bottle, I should want
to close it speedily with something near at hand.
Well, a bit of paper would not do, but a piece
of linen cloth would, or some of this cotton
wool which I have here. I will put a tuft of it
into the neck of the alcohol bottle, and you see,
when I turn it upside down, that it is perfectly
well stoppered, so far as the alcohol is concerned;
the air can pass through, but the alcohol cannot.
And if I were to take an oil vessel, this plan
would do equally well, for in former times they
used to send us oil from Italy in flasks stoppered
only with cotton wool (at the present time
the cotton is put in after the oil has arrived
here, but formerly it used to be sent so stoppered).
Now, if it were not for the particles of
liquid cohering together, this alcohol would run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
out; and if I had time, I could have shewn you
a vessel with the top, bottom, and sides altogether
formed like a sieve, and yet it would hold
water, owing to this cohesion.</p>

<p>You have now seen that the solid water can
become fluid by the addition of heat, owing to
this lessening the attractive force between its
particles, and yet you see that there is a good
deal of attractive force remaining behind. I
want now to take you another step beyond.
We saw that if we continued applying heat to
the water (as indeed happened with our piece
of ice here), that we did at last break up that
attraction which holds the liquid together; and
I am about to take some ether (any other liquid
would do, but ether makes a better experiment
for my purpose), in order to illustrate what will
happen when this cohesion is broken up. Now,
this liquid ether, if exposed to a very low temperature,
will become a solid; but if we apply
heat to it, it becomes vapour, and I want to
shew you the enormous bulk of the substance in
this new form&mdash;when we make ice into water,
we lessen its bulk, but when we convert water
into steam, we increase it to an enormous ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>tent.
You see it is very clear that as I apply
heat to the liquid I diminish its attraction of
cohesion&mdash;it is now boiling, and I will set fire
to the vapour, so that you may be enabled to
judge of the space occupied by the ether in this
form by the size of its flame, and you now see
what an enormously bulky flame I get from
that small volume of ether below. The heat
from the spirit-lamp is now being consumed,
not in making the ether any warmer, but in
converting it into vapour; and if I desired to
catch this vapour and condense it (as I could
without much difficulty), I should have to do
the same as if I wished to convert steam into
water and water into ice: in either case it would
be necessary to increase the attraction of the
particles, by cold or otherwise. So largely is
the bulk occupied by the particles increased by
giving them this diminished attraction, that if
I were to take a portion of water a cubic inch in
bulk (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, fig. 23) I should produce a volume of
steam of that size, <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span> [1700 cubic inches; nearly
a cubic foot], so greatly is the attraction of
cohesion diminished by heat; and yet it still
remains water. You can easily imagine the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
consequences which are due to this change in
volume by heat&mdash;the mighty powers of steam
and the tremendous explosions which are sometimes
produced by this force of water. I want
you now to see another experiment, which will
perhaps give you a better illustration of the bulk
occupied by a body when in the state of vapour.
Here is a substance which we call iodine, and I
am about to submit this solid body to the same
kind of condition as regards heat that I did
the water and the ether [putting a few grains of
iodine into a hot glass globe, which immediately
became filled with the violet vapour], and you
see the same kind of change produced. Moreover,
it gives us the opportunity of observing
how beautiful is the violet-coloured vapour from
this black substance, or rather the mixture of
the vapour with air (for I would not wish you
to understand that this globe is entirely filled
with the vapour of iodine).</p>

<p>If I had taken mercury and converted it into
vapour (as I could easily do), I should have a
perfectly colourless vapour; for you must understand
this about vapours, that bodies in what
we call the vaporous, or the gaseous state, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
always perfectly transparent, never cloudy or
smoky: they are, however, often coloured, and
we can frequently have coloured vapours or
gases produced by colourless particles themselves
mixing together, as in this case [the Lecturer
here inverted a glass cylinder full of binoxide of
nitrogen<a id="FNanchor_16_17" href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">16</a> over a cylinder of oxygen, when the
dark-red vapour of hypo-nitrous acid was produced].
Here also you see a very excellent
illustration of the effect of a power of nature
which we have not as yet come to, but which
stands next on our list&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chemical Affinity</span>.
And thus you see we can have a violet vapour
or an orange vapour, and different other kinds
of vapour; but they are always perfectly transparent,
or else they would cease to be vapours.</p>

<p>I am now going to lead you a step beyond
this consideration of the attraction of the particles
for each other. You see we have come to
understand that, if we take water as an illustration,
whether it be ice, or water, or steam, it is
always to be considered by us as water. Well,
now prepare your minds to go a little deeper
into the subject. We have means of searching
into the constitution of water beyond any that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
are afforded us by the action of heat, and
among these one of the most important is that
force which we call voltaic electricity, which we
used at our last meeting for the purpose of
obtaining light, and which we carried about
the room by means of these wires. This force
is produced by the battery behind me, to which,
however, I will not now refer more particularly:
before we have done we shall know more about
this battery, but it must grow up in our knowledge
as we proceed. Now, here (fig. 24) is a
portion of water in this little vessel <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, and
besides the water there are two plates of the
metal platinum, which are connected with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
wires (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>) coming outside, and I want
to examine that water, and the state and the
condition in which its particles are arranged.
If I were to apply heat to it, you know what
we should get; it would assume the state of
vapour, but it would nevertheless remain water,
and would return to the liquid state as soon as
the heat was removed. Now, by means of these
wires (which are connected with the battery
behind me, and come under the floor and up
through the table), we shall have a certain
amount of this new power at our disposal.
Here you see it is [causing the ends of the
wires to touch]&mdash;that is the electric light we
used yesterday, and by means of these wires
we can cause water to submit itself to this
power; for the moment I put them into metallic
connection (at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>), you see the water
boiling in that little vessel (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>), and you hear the
bubbling of the gas that is going through the
tube (<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>). See how I am converting the water
into vapour; and if I take a little vessel (<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>), and
fill it with water, and put it in the trough over
the end of the tube (<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>), there goes the vapour
ascending into the vessel. And yet that is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
steam; for you know that if steam is brought
near cold water, it would at once condense, and
return back again to water. This then cannot
be steam, for it is bubbling through the cold
water in this trough; but it is a vaporous substance,
and we must therefore examine it carefully,
to see in what way the water has been
changed. And now, in order to give you a proof
that it is not steam, I am going to shew you
that it is combustible; for if I take this small
vessel to a light, the vapour inside explodes in
a manner that steam could never do.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_024.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 24.</div>
</div>

<p>I will now fill this large bell-jar (<span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>) with
water; and I propose letting the gas ascend
into it, and I will then shew you that we can
reproduce the water back again from the
vapour or air that is there. Here is a strong
glass vessel (<span class="smcap lowercase">G</span>), and into it we will let the gas
(from <span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>) pass. We will there fire it by the
electric spark, and then after the explosion you
will find that we have got the water back
again: it will not be much, however, for you
will recollect that I shewed you how small a
portion of water produced a very large volume
of vapour. Mr. Anderson will now pump all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the air out of this vessel (<span class="smcap lowercase">G</span>); and when I have
screwed it on to the top of our jar of gas (<span class="smcap lowercase">F</span>),
you will see upon opening the stop-cocks (<span class="smcap lowercase">H´ H H</span>)
the water will jump up, shewing that some of
the gas has passed into the glass vessel. I will
now shut these stop-cocks, and we shall be able
to send the electric spark through the gas by
means of the wires (<span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">K</span>) in the upper part of
the vessel, and you will see it burn with a most
intense flash. [Mr. Anderson here brought a
Leyden jar, which he discharged through the
confined gas by means of the wires <span class="smcap lowercase">I</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">K</span>.] You
saw the flash; and now that you may see that
there is no longer any gas remaining, if I place
it over the jar and open the stop-cocks again,
up will go the gas, and we can have a second
combustion; and so I might go on again and
again, and I should continue to accumulate
more and more of the water to which the gas
has returned. Now, is not this curious?&mdash;in
this vessel (<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>) we can go on making from water
a large bulk of <i>permanent gas</i>, as we call it,
and then we can reconvert it into water in this
way. [Mr. Anderson brought in another Leyden
jar, which, however, from some cause would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
ignite the gas. It was therefore recharged,
when the explosion took place in the desired
manner.] How beautifully we get our results
when we are right in our proceedings!&mdash;it is
not that Nature is wrong when we make a
mistake. Now, I will lay this vessel (<span class="smcap lowercase">G</span>) down
by my right hand, and you can examine it by
and by: there is not very much water flowing
down, but there is quite sufficient for you to
see.</p>

<p>Another wonderful thing about this mode of
changing the condition of the water is this&mdash;that
we are able to get the separate parts of
which it is composed, at a distance the one from
the other, and to examine them, and see what
they are like, and how many of them there are;
and for this purpose I have here some more
water in a slightly different apparatus to the
former one (fig. 25), and if I place this in connection
with the wires of the battery (at <span class="smcap lowercase">A B</span>), I
shall get a similar decomposition of the water
at the two platinum plates. Now, I will put
this little tube (<span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>) over there, and that will
collect the gas together that comes from this
side (<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>), and this tube (<span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>) will collect the gas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
that comes from the other side (<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>); and I think
we shall soon be able to see a difference. In
this apparatus the wires are a good way apart
from each other, and it now seems that <i>each</i>
of them is capable of drawing off particles from
the water and sending them off, and you see
that one set of particles (<span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>) is coming off twice
as fast as those collected in the other tube (<span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>).
Something is coming out of the water <i>there</i>
(at <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>) which burns [setting fire to the gas]; but
what comes out of the water <i>here</i> (at <span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>),
although it will not burn, will support combustion
very vigorously. [The Lecturer here
placed a match with a glowing tip in the gas,
when it immediately rekindled.]</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_025.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 25.</div>
</div>

<p>Here, then, we have two things, neither of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
them being water alone, but which we get out
of the water. Water is therefore composed of
two substances different to itself, which appear
at separate places when it is made to submit to
the force which I have in these wires; and if I
take an inverted tube of water and collect this
gas (<span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>), you will see that it is by no means the
same as the one we collected in the former
apparatus (fig. 24). That exploded with a loud
noise when it was lighted, but this will burn
quite noiselessly&mdash;it is called <i>hydrogen</i>; and
the other we call <i>oxygen</i>&mdash;that gas which so
beautifully brightens up all combustion, but
does not burn of itself. So now we see that
water consists of two kinds of particles attracting
each other in a very different manner to the
attraction of gravitation or cohesion; and this
new attraction we call <i>chemical affinity</i>, or the
force of chemical action between different
bodies. We are now no longer concerned with
the attraction of iron for iron, water for water,
wood for wood, or like bodies for each other, as
we were when dealing with the force of cohesion:
we are dealing with another kind of attraction,&mdash;the
attraction between particles of a <i>different</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
nature one to the other. Chemical affinity
depends entirely upon the energy with which
particles of <i>different</i> kinds attract each other.
Oxygen and hydrogen are particles of different
kinds, and it is their attraction to each other
which makes them chemically combine and
produce water.</p>

<p>I must now shew you a little more at large
what chemical affinity is. I can prepare these
gases from other substances, as well as from
water; and we will now prepare some oxygen.
Here is another substance which contains oxygen&mdash;chlorate
of potash. I will put some of it into
this glass retort, and Mr. Anderson will apply
heat to it. We have here different jars filled
with water; and when, by the application of
heat, the chlorate of potash is decomposed, we
will displace the water, and fill the jars with
gas.</p>

<p>Now, when water is opened out in this way
by means of the battery&mdash;which adds nothing
to it materially, which takes nothing from it
materially (I mean no <i>matter</i>; I am not speaking
of <i>force</i>), which adds no <i>matter</i> to the
water&mdash;it is changed in this way: the gas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
which you saw burning a little while ago,
called <i>hydrogen</i>, is evolved in large quantity,
and the other gas, <i>oxygen</i>, is evolved in only
half the quantity; so that these two areas
represent water, and these are always the proportions
between the two gases.</p>

<p>But oxygen is sixteen times the weight

<p>Now, Mr. Anderson has prepared some oxy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>gen,
and we will proceed to examine what
is the character of this gas. First of all, you
remember, I told you that it does not burn,
but that it affects the burning of other bodies.
I will just set fire to the point of this little
bit of wood, and then plunge it into the jar
of oxygen, and you will see what this gas
does in increasing the brilliancy of the combustion.
It does not burn&mdash;it does not take
fire as the hydrogen would&mdash;but how vividly
the combustion of the match goes on. Again,
if I were to take this wax taper and light
it, and turn it upside down in the air, it
would in all probability put itself out, owing
to the wax running down into the wick. [The
Lecturer here turned the lighted taper upside
down, when in a few seconds it went out.] Now,
that will not happen in oxygen gas; you will
see how differently it acts (fig. 26). [The taper
was again lighted, turned upside down, and
then introduced into a jar of oxygen.] Look at
that! see how the very wax itself burns, and falls
down in a dazzling stream of fire, so powerfully
does the oxygen support combustion. Again,
here is another experiment which will serve to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
illustrate the force, if I may so call it, of oxygen.
I have here a circular flame of spirit of wine,
and with it I am about to shew you the way
in which iron burns, because it will serve very
well as a comparison between the effect produced
by air and oxygen. If I take this ring flame,
I can shake by means of a sieve the fine
particles of iron filings through it, and you
will see the way in which they burn. [The
Lecturer here shook through the flame some
iron filings, which took fire and fell through
with beautiful scintillations.] But if I now
hold the flame over a jar of oxygen [the experiment
was repeated over a jar of oxygen,
when the combustion of the filings, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
fell into the oxygen, became almost insupportably
brilliant], you see how wonderfully
different the effect is in the jar; because
there we have oxygen instead of common
air.</p>

<small>CHEMICAL AFFINITY&mdash;HEAT.</small></h2>


<p>We shall have to pay a little more attention
to the forces existing in
water before we can have a clear idea on the
subject. Besides the attraction which there
is between its particles to make it hold together
as a liquid or a solid, there is also
another force, different from the former&mdash;one
which, yesterday, by means of the voltaic
battery, we overcame, drawing from the water
two different substances&mdash;which, when heated
by means of the electric spark, attracted each
other, and rushed into combination to reproduce
water. Now, I propose to-day to continue this
subject, and trace the various phenomena of
chemical affinity; and for this purpose, as we
yesterday considered the character of oxygen, of
which I have here two jars (oxygen being those
particles derived from the water which enable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
other bodies to burn), we will now consider
the other constituent of water; and, without
embarrassing you too much with the way in
which these things are made, I will proceed
now to shew you our common way of making
<i>hydrogen</i>. (I called it hydrogen yesterday&mdash;it
is so called because it helps to generate
water.)<a id="FNanchor_A_1" href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">A</a> I put into this retort some zinc, water,
and oil of vitriol, and immediately an action
takes place, which produces an abundant evolution
of gas, now coming over into this jar,
and bubbling up in appearance exactly like
the oxygen we obtained yesterday.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_027.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 27.</div>
</div>

<p>The processes, you see, are very different,
though the result is the same, in so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
as it gives us certain gaseous particles. Here,
then, is the hydrogen. I shewed you yesterday
certain qualities of this gas; now let me exhibit
you some other properties. Unlike oxygen,
which is a supporter of combustion, and will
not burn, hydrogen itself is combustible. There
is a jar full of it; and if I carry it along in
this manner, and put a light to it, I think
you will see it take fire, not with a bright light&mdash;you
will at all events hear it, if you do not
see it. Now, that is a body entirely different
from oxygen: it is extremely light; for although
yesterday you saw twice as much of this
hydrogen produced on the one side as on
the other, by the voltaic battery, it was only
one-eighth the weight of the oxygen. I carry
this jar upside-down. Why? Because I know
that it is a very light body, and that it will
continue in this jar upside-down quite as
effectually as the water will in that jar which
is not upside-down; and just as I can pour
water from one vessel into another in the
right position to receive it, so can I pour
this gas from one jar into another when they
are upside-down. See what I am about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
do. There is no hydrogen in this jar at present,
but I will gently turn this jar of hydrogen
up under this other jar (fig. 28), and then we
will examine the two. We shall see, on applying
a light, that the hydrogen has left the
jar in which it was at first, and has poured
upwards into the other, and there we shall
find it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_028.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 28.</div>
</div>

<p>You now understand that we can have particles
of very different kinds, and that they can
have different bulks and weights; and there are
two or three very interesting experiments which
serve to illustrate this. For instance, if I blow
soap bubbles with the breath from my mouth,
you will see them fall, because I fill them with
common air, and the water which forms the
bubble carries it down. But now, if I inhale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
hydrogen gas into my lungs (it does no harm
to the lungs, although it does no good to them),
see what happens. [The Lecturer inhaled some
hydrogen, and after one or two ineffectual
attempts, succeeded in blowing a splendid
bubble, which rose majestically and slowly to
the ceiling of the theatre, where it burst.] That
shews you very well how light a substance this
is; for, notwithstanding all the heavy bad air
from my lungs, and the weight of the bubble,
you saw how it was carried up. I want you
now to consider this phenomenon of weight as
indicating how exceedingly different particles are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
one from the other; and I will take as illustrations
these very common things&mdash;air, water, the
heaviest body, platinum, and this gas: and observe
how they differ in this respect; for if I
take a piece of platinum of that size (fig. 29),
it is equal to the weight of portions of water,
air, and hydrogen of the bulks I have represented
in these spheres. And this illustration
gives you a very good idea of the extraordinary
difference with regard to the gravity of the
articles having this enormous difference in bulk.
[The following tabular statement having reference
to this illustration appeared on the diagram
board.]</p>

<p>
Whenever oxygen and hydrogen unite together
they produce water; and you have seen
the extraordinary difference between the bulk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
and appearance of the water so produced, and
the particles of which it consists chemically.
Now, we have never yet been able to reduce
either oxygen or hydrogen to the liquid state;
and yet their first impulse, when chemically
combined, is to take up first this liquid condition,
and then the solid condition. We never combine
these different particles together without
producing water; and it is curious to think how
often you must have made the experiment of
combining oxygen and hydrogen to form water
without knowing it. Take a candle, for instance,
and a clean silver spoon (or a piece of
clean tin will do), and if you hold it over the
flame, you immediately cover it with dew&mdash;not
a smoke&mdash;which presently evaporates. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
perhaps will serve to shew it better. Mr. Anderson
will put a candle under that jar, and
you will see how soon the water is produced
(fig. 30). Look at that dimness on the sides
of the glass, which will soon produce drops, and
trickle down into the plate. Well, that dimness
and these drops are <i>water</i>, formed by the
union of the oxygen of the air with the hydrogen
existing in the wax of which that candle
is formed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_030.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 30.</div>
</div>

<p>And now, having brought you in the first
place to the consideration of chemical attraction,
I must enlarge your ideas so as to include
all substances which have this attraction for
each other&mdash;for it changes the character of
bodies, and alters them in this way and that
way in the most extraordinary manner, and
produces other phenomena wonderful to think
about. Here is some chlorate of potash, and
there some sulphuret of antimony.<a id="FNanchor_17_18" href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">17</a> We will
mix these two different sets of particles together;
and I want to shew you in a general sort of
way some of the phenomena which take place
when we make different particles act together.
Now, I can make these bodies act upon each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
other in several ways. In this case I am going
to apply heat to the mixture; but if I were to
give a blow with a hammer, the same result
would follow. [A lighted match was brought
to the mixture, which immediately exploded
with a sudden flash, evolving a dense white
smoke.] There you see the result of the action
of chemical affinity overcoming the attraction
of cohesion of the particles. Again, here is a
little sugar<a id="FNanchor_18_19" href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">18</a>, quite a different substance from
the black sulphuret of antimony, and you shall
see what takes place when we put the two together.
[The mixture was touched with sulphuric
acid, when it took fire and burnt
gradually, and with a brighter flame than in
the former instance.] Observe this chemical
affinity travelling about the mass, and setting
it on fire, and throwing it into such wonderful
agitation!
</p>
<p>
I must now come to a few circumstances
which require careful consideration. We have
already examined one of the effects of this
chemical affinity; but to make the matter more
clear we must point out some others. And
here are two salts dissolved in water<a id="FNanchor_19_20" href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">19</a>. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
are both colourless solutions, and in these
glasses you cannot see any difference between
them. But if I mix them, I shall have chemical
attraction take place. I will pour the two
together into this glass, and you will at once
see, I have no doubt, a certain amount of
change. Look, they are already becoming
milky, but they are sluggish in their action&mdash;not
quick as the others were&mdash;for we have endless
varieties of rapidity in chemical action.
Now, if I mix them together, and stir them, so
as to bring them properly together, you will
soon see what a different result is produced.
As I mix them, they get thicker and thicker,
and you see the liquid is hardening and stiffening,
and before long I shall have it quite hard;
and before the end of the lecture it will be a
solid stone&mdash;a wet stone, no doubt, but more
or less solid&mdash;in consequence of the chemical
affinity. Is not this changing two liquids into
a solid body a wonderful manifestation of
chemical affinity?
</p>
<p>
There is another remarkable circumstance in
chemical affinity, which is, that it is capable
of either waiting or acting at once. And this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
is very singular, because we know of nothing of
the kind in the forces either of gravitation or
cohesion. For instance, here are some oxygen
particles, and here is a lump of carbon particles.
I am going to put the carbon particles into the
oxygen; they <i>can</i> act, but they <i>do</i> not&mdash;they
are just like this unlighted candle. It stands
here quietly on the table, waiting until we want
to light it. But it is not so in this other case.
Here is a substance, gaseous like the oxygen,
and if I put these particles of metal into it,
the two combine at once. The copper and
the chlorine unite by their power of chemical
affinity, and produce a body entirely unlike
either of the substances used. And in this
other case, it is not that there is any deficiency
of affinity between the carbon and oxygen;
for the moment I choose to put them in a
condition to exert their affinity, you will see the
difference. [The piece of charcoal was ignited,
and introduced into the jar of oxygen, when
the combustion proceeded with vivid scintillations.]
</p>
<p>
Now, this chemical action is set going exactly
as it would be if I had lighted the candle, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
as it is when the servant puts coals on and
lights the fire: the substances wait until we do
something which is able to start the action.
Can anything be more beautiful than this combustion
of charcoal in oxygen? You must
understand that each of these little sparks is a
portion of the charcoal, or the bark of the
charcoal, thrown off white-hot into the oxygen,
and burning in it most brilliantly, as you see.
And now let me tell you another thing, or you
will go away with a very imperfect notion of
the powers and effects of this affinity. There
you see some charcoal burning in oxygen.
Well, a piece of lead will burn in oxygen just
as well as the charcoal does, or indeed better;
for absolutely that piece of lead will act at once
upon the oxygen as the copper did in the other
vessel with regard to the chlorine. And here
also a piece of iron: if I light it and put it into
the oxygen, it will burn away just as the carbon
did. And I will take some lead, and shew you
that it will burn in the common atmospheric
oxygen at the ordinary temperature. These
are the lumps of lead which, you remember, we
had the other day&mdash;the two pieces which clung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
together. Now these pieces, if I take them
to-day and press them together, will not stick;
and the reason is, that they have attracted from
the atmosphere a part of the oxygen there
present, and have become coated as with a
varnish by the oxide of lead, which is formed
on the surface by a real process of combustion
or combination. There you see the iron burning
very well in oxygen; and I will tell you the
reason why those scissors and that lead do
not take fire whilst they are lying on the table.
Here the lead is in a lump, and the coating of
oxide remains on its surface; whilst there you
see the melted oxide is clearing itself off from
the iron, and allowing more and more to go on
burning. In this case, however [holding up a
small glass tube containing lead pyrophorus.<a id="FNanchor_20_21" href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">20</a>,
the lead has been very carefully produced in
fine powder, and put into a glass tube, and
hermetically sealed, so as to preserve it; and I
expect you will see it take fire at once. This
has been made about a month ago, and has
thus had time enough to sink down to its
normal temperature. What you see, therefore,
is the result of chemical affinity alone. [The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
tube was broken at the end, and the lead
poured out on to a piece of paper, whereupon
it immediately took fire.] Look, look at the
lead burning; why, it has set fire to the paper!
Now, that is nothing more than the common
affinity always existing between very clean lead
and the atmospheric oxygen; and the reason
why this iron does not burn until it is made
red-hot is, because it has got a coating of oxide
about it, which stops the action of the oxygen&mdash;putting
a varnish, as it were, upon its surface,
as we varnish a picture, absolutely forming a
substance which prevents the natural chemical
affinity between the bodies from acting.</p>

<p>I must now take you a little further in this
kind of illustration&mdash;or consideration, I would
rather call it&mdash;of chemical affinity. This attraction
between different particles exists also most
curiously in cases where they are previously
combined with other substances. Here is a
little chlorate of potash, containing the oxygen
which we found yesterday could be procured
from it. It contains the oxygen there combined
and held down by its chemical affinity with
other things; but still it can combine with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
sugar, as you saw. This affinity can thus act
<i>across</i> substances; and I want you to see how
curiously what we call combustion acts with
respect to this force of chemical affinity. If I
take a piece of phosphorus and set fire to it, and
then place a jar of air over the phosphorus,
you see the combustion which we are having
there on account of chemical affinity (combustion
being in all cases the result of chemical
affinity). The phosphorus is escaping in that
vapour, which will condense into a snow-like
mass at the close of the lecture. But suppose
I limit the atmosphere, what then? why, even
the phosphorus will go out. Here is a piece
of camphor, which will burn very well in the
atmosphere, and even on water it will float
about and burn, by reason of some of its particles
gaining access to the air. But if I limit
the quantity of air by placing a jar over it, as
I am now doing, you will soon find the camphor
will go out. Well, why does it go out? Not for
want of air, for there is plenty of air remaining
in the jar. Perhaps you will be shrewd enough
to say, for want of oxygen.</p>

<p>This, therefore, leads us to the inquiry as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
whether oxygen can do more than a certain
amount of work. The oxygen there (fig. 30)
cannot go on burning an unlimited quantity of
candle, for that has gone out, as you see; and
its amount of chemical attraction or affinity is
just as strikingly limited: it can no more be
fallen short of or exceeded than can the attraction
of gravitation. You might as soon attempt
to destroy gravitation, or weight, or all things
that exist, as to destroy the exact amount of
force exerted by this oxygen. And when I
pointed out to you that 8 by weight of oxygen
to 1 by weight of hydrogen went to form water,
I meant this, that neither of them would combine
in different proportions with the other; for
you cannot get 10 of hydrogen to combine with
6 of oxygen, or 10 of oxygen to combine with
6 of hydrogen&mdash;it must be 8 of oxygen and 1
of hydrogen. Now, suppose I limit the action
in this way: this piece of cotton wool burns,
as you see, very well in the atmosphere; and I
have known of cases of cotton-mills being fired
as if with gunpowder, through the very finely-divided
particles of cotton being diffused through
the atmosphere in the mill, when it has some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>times
happened that a flame has caught these
raised particles, and it has run from one end of
the mill to the other, and blown it up. That,
then, is on account of the affinity which the
cotton has for the oxygen; but suppose I set
fire to this piece of cotton, which is rolled up
tightly, it does not go on burning, because I
have limited the supply of oxygen, and the
inside is prevented from having access to the
oxygen, just as it was in the case of the lead
by the oxide. But here is some cotton which
has been imbued with oxygen in a certain
manner. I need not trouble you now with the
way it is prepared; it is called gun-cotton.<a id="FNanchor_21_22" href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">21</a>
See how that burns [setting fire to a piece]; it
is very different from the other, because the
oxygen that must be present in its proper
amount is put there beforehand. And I have
here some pieces of paper which are prepared
like the gun-cotton<a id="FNanchor_22_23" href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">22</a>, and imbued with bodies
containing oxygen. Here is some which has
been soaked in nitrate of strontia&mdash;you will see
the beautiful red colour of its flame; and here is
another which I think contains baryta, which
gives that fine green light; and I have here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
some more which has been soaked in nitrate of
copper&mdash;it does not burn quite so brightly, but
still very beautifully. In all these cases the
combustion goes on independent of the oxygen
of the atmosphere. And here we have some
gunpowder put into a case, in order to shew
that it is capable of burning under water. You
know that we put it into a gun, shutting off the
atmosphere, with shot, and yet the oxygen
which it contains supplies the particles with
that without which chemical action could not
proceed. Now, I have a vessel of water here,
and am going to make the experiment of putting
this fuse under the water, and you will see
whether that water can extinguish it. Here it is
burning out of the water, and there it is burning
under the water; and so it will continue until
exhausted, and all by reason of the requisite
amount of oxygen being contained within the
substance. It is by this kind of attraction of
the different particles one to the other that
we are enabled to trace the laws of chemical
affinity, and the wonderful variety of the exertions
of these laws.</p>

<p>Now, I want you to observe that one great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
exertion of this power, which is known as
<i>chemical affinity</i>, is to produce <span class="smcap lowercase">HEAT</span> and light.
You know, as a matter of fact, no doubt, that
when bodies burn they give out heat; but it is
a curious thing that this heat does not continue&mdash;the
heat goes away as soon as the action
stops, and you see thereby that it depends upon
the action <i>during the time</i> it is going on. It
is not so with gravitation: this force is continuous,
and is just as effective in making that
lead press on the table as it was when it first
fell there. Nothing occurs there which disappears
when the action of falling is over; the
pressure is upon the table, and will remain there
until the lead is removed; whereas, in the action
of chemical affinity to give light and heat, they
go away immediately the action is over. This
lamp <i>seems</i> to evolve heat and light continuously;
but it is owing to a constant stream
of air coming into it on all sides, and this work
of producing light and heat by chemical affinity
will subside as soon as the stream of air is
interrupted. What, then, is this curious condition
of heat? Why is the evolution of another
power of matter, of a power new to us, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
which we must consider as if it were now for
the very first time brought under our notice?
What is heat? We recognise heat by its power
of liquefying solid bodies and vaporising liquid
bodies, by its power of setting in action, and
very often overcoming, chemical affinity. Then,
how do we obtain heat? We obtain it in
various ways&mdash;most abundantly by means of
the chemical affinity we have just before been
speaking about; but we can also obtain it in
many other ways. Friction will produce heat.
The Indians rub pieces of wood together until
they make them hot enough to take fire; and
such things have been known as two branches
of a tree rubbing together so hard as to set the
tree on fire. I do not suppose I shall set these
two pieces of wood on fire by friction; but I
can readily produce heat enough to ignite some
phosphorus. [The Lecturer here rubbed two
pieces of cedar-wood strongly against each
other for a minute, and then placed on them
a piece of phosphorus, which immediately
took fire.] And if you take a smooth metal
button stuck on a cork, and rub it on a piece
of soft deal wood, you will make it so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
hot as to scorch wood and paper, and burn a
match.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig_031.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 31.</div>
</div>

<p>I am now going to shew you that
we can obtain heat, not by chemical
affinity alone, but by the pressure of
air. Suppose I take a pellet of cotton
and moisten it with a little ether, and
put it into a glass tube (fig. 31), and
then take a piston and press it down
suddenly, I expect I shall be able to
burn a little of that ether in the vessel.
It wants a suddenness of pressure,
or we shall not do what we require. [The piston
was forcibly pressed down, when a flame, due
to the combustion of the ether, was visible in
the lower part of the syringe.] All we want
is to get a little ether in vapour, and give fresh
air each time, and so we may go on again and
again getting heat enough by the compression
of air to fire the ether-vapour.</p>

<p>This, then, I think, will be sufficient, accompanied
with all you have previously seen, to
shew you how we procure heat. And now for
the effects of this power. We need not consider
many of them on the present occasion, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
when you have seen its power of changing ice
into water and water into steam, you have seen
the two principal results of the application of
heat. I want you now to see how it expands
all bodies&mdash;all bodies but one, and that under
limited circumstances. Mr. Anderson will hold
a lamp under that retort, and you will see the
moment he does so that the air will issue
abundantly from the neck, which is under water,
because the heat which he applies to the air
causes it to expand. And here is a brass rod
(fig. 32) which goes through that hole, and fits
also accurately into this gauge; but if I make it
warm with this spirit-lamp, it will only go in the
gauge or through the hole with difficulty; and
if I were to put it into boiling-water, it would
not go through at all. Again, as soon as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
heat escapes from bodies they collapse. See how
the air is contracting in the vessel, now that Mr.
Anderson has taken away his lamp: the stem
of it is filling with water. Notice, too, now, that
although I cannot get the tube through this
hole or into the gauge, the moment I cool it
by dipping it into water, it goes through with
perfect facility; so that we have a perfect proof
of this power of heat to contract and expand
bodies.</p>

<h2 title="MAGNETISM&mdash;ELECTRICITY.">LECTURE V.<br />

<small>MAGNETISM&mdash;ELECTRICITY.</small></h2>


<p>I wonder whether we shall be too deep
to-day or not. Remember that we spoke
of the attraction by gravitation of <i>all</i> bodies to
all bodies by their simple approach. Remember
that we spoke of the attraction of particles of the
<i>same</i> kind to each other,&mdash;that power which keeps
them together in masses,&mdash;iron attracted to iron,
brass to brass, or water to water. Remember
that we found, on looking into water, that there
were particles of two different kinds attracted to
each other; and this was a great step beyond
the first simple attraction of gravitation; because
here we deal with attraction between <i>different</i>
kinds of matter. The hydrogen could attract
the oxygen, and reduce it to water, but it could
not attract any of its own particles; so that there
we obtained a first indication of the existence of
<i>two</i> attractions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>To-day we come to a kind of attraction even
more curious than the last, namely, the attraction
which we find to be of a double nature&mdash;of
a curious and dual nature. And I want first
of all to make the nature of this doubleness
clear to you. Bodies are sometimes endowed
with a wonderful attraction, which is not found
in them in their ordinary state. For instance,
here is a piece of shell-lac, having the attraction
of gravitation, having the attraction of cohesion;
and if I set fire to it, it would have the attraction
of chemical affinity to the oxygen in the
atmosphere. Now, all these powers we find <i>in</i>
it as if they were parts of its substance; but
there is another property which I will try and
make evident by means of this ball, this bubble
of air [a light india-rubber ball, inflated and
suspended by a thread]. There is no attraction
between this ball and this shell-lac at present:
there may be a little wind in the room slightly
moving the ball about, but there is no attraction.
But if I rub the shell-lac with a piece of
flannel [rubbing the shell-lac, and then holding
it near the ball], look at the attraction which
has arisen out of the shell-lac, simply by this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
friction, and which I may take away as easily
by drawing it gently through my hand. [The
Lecturer repeated the experiment of exciting
the shell-lac, and then removing the attractive
power by drawing it through his hand.] Again,
you will see I can repeat this experiment with
another substance; for if I take a glass rod and
rub it with a piece of silk covered with what
we call amalgam, look at the attraction which
it has, how it draws the ball towards it; and
then, as before, by quietly rubbing it through
the hand, the attraction will be all removed
again, to come back by friction with this silk.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_033.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 33.</div>
</div>

<p>But now we come to another fact. I will
take this piece of shell-lac and make it attractive
by friction; and remember that whenever we
get an attraction of gravity, chemical affinity,
adhesion, or electricity (as in this case), the
body which attracts is attracted also; and just
as much as that ball was attracted by the
shell-lac, the shell-lac was attracted by the ball.
Now, I will suspend this piece of excited shell-lac
in a little paper stirrup, in this way (fig. 33), in
order to make it move easily, and I will take
another piece of shell-lac, and after rubbing it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
with flannel, will bring them near together.
You will think that they ought to attract each
other; but now what happens? It does not
attract; on the contrary, it very strongly <i>repels</i>,
and I can thus drive it round to any extent.
These, therefore, repel each other, although
they are so strongly attractive&mdash;repel each
other to the extent of driving this heavy piece
of shell-lac round and round in this way. But if
I excite this piece of shell-lac, as before, and take
this piece of glass and rub it with silk, and
then bring them near, what think you will
happen? [The Lecturer held the excited glass
near the excited shell-lac, when they attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
each other strongly.] You see, therefore, what
a difference there is between these two attractions,&mdash;they
are actually two <i>kinds</i> of attraction
concerned in this case, quite different to
anything we have met with before; but the
<i>force</i> is the same. We have here, then, a
double attraction&mdash;a dual attraction or force&mdash;one
attracting, and the other repelling.</p>

<p>Again, to shew you another experiment
which will help to make this clear to you.
Suppose I set up this rough indicator again
[the excited shell-lac suspended in the stirrup]&mdash;it
is rough, but delicate enough for my purpose;
and suppose I take this other piece of shell-lac,
and take away the power, which I can do by
drawing it gently through the hand; and suppose
I take a piece of flannel (fig. 34), which I
have shaped into a cap for it and made dry.
I will put this shell-lac into the flannel, and here
comes out a very beautiful result. I will rub
this shell-lac and the flannel together (which I
can do by twisting the shell-lac round), and leave
them in contact; and then, if I ask, by bringing
them nearer our indicator, what is the attractive
force?&mdash;it is nothing! But if I take them apart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
and then ask what will they do when they are
separated&mdash;why, the shell-lac is strongly repelled,
as it was before, but the cap is strongly attractive;
and yet if I bring them both together again, there
is no attraction&mdash;it has all disappeared [the
experiment was repeated]. Those two bodies,
therefore, still contain this attractive power:
when they were parted, it was evident to your
senses that they had it, though they do not
attract when they are together.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_035.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 35.</div>
</div>

<p>This, then, is sufficient in the outset to give
you an idea of the nature of the force which
we call <span class="smcap lowercase">ELECTRICITY</span>. There is no end to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
things from which you can evolve this power.
When you go home, take a stick of sealing-wax&mdash;I
have rather a large stick, but a smaller one
will do&mdash;and make an indicator of this sort
(fig. 35). Take a watch-glass (or your watch
itself will do; you only want something which
shall have a round face), and now, if you place a
piece of flat glass upon that, you have a very
easily moved centre. And if I take this lath and
put it on the flat glass (you see I am searching
for the centre of gravity of this lath&mdash;I want to
balance it upon the watch-glass), it is very
easily moved round; and if I take this piece of
sealing-wax and rub it against my coat, and
then try whether it is attractive [holding it near
the lath], you see how strong the attraction is;
I can even draw it about. Here, then, you have
a very beautiful indicator, for I have, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
small piece of sealing-wax and my coat, pulled
round a plank of that kind; so you need be in
no want of indicators to discover the presence
of this attraction. There is scarcely a substance
which we may not use. Here are some indicators
(fig. 36). I bend round a strip of paper into
a hoop, and we have as good an indicator as can
be required. See how it rolls along, travelling
after the sealing-wax. If I make them smaller,
of course we have them running faster, and
sometimes they are actually attracted up into
the air. Here also is a little collodion balloon.
It is so electrical that it will scarcely leave my
hand unless to go to the other. See, how curiously
electrical it is: it is hardly possible for me
to touch it without making it electrical; and
here is a piece which clings to anything it is
brought near, and which it is not easy to lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
down. And here is another substance, gutta-percha,
in thin strips: it is astonishing how, by
rubbing this in your hands, you make it electrical.
But our time forbids us to go further into
this subject at present. You see clearly there are
two kinds of electricities which may be obtained
by rubbing shell-lac with flannel, or glass with
silk.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_036.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 36.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, there are some curious bodies in nature
(of which I have two specimens on the table)
which are called <i>magnets</i> or <i>loadstones</i>&mdash;ores of
iron, of which there is a great deal sent from
Sweden. They have the attraction of gravitation,
and attraction of cohesion, and certain
chemical attraction; but they also have a great
attractive power, for this little key is held up
by this stone. Now, that is not chemical
attraction,&mdash;it is not the attraction of chemical
affinity, or of aggregation of particles, or of
cohesion, or of electricity (for it will not
attract this ball if I bring it near it); but it is
a separate and dual attraction&mdash;and, what is
more, one which is not readily removed from
the substance, for it has existed in it for ages
and ages in the bowels of the earth. Now, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
can make artificial magnets (you will see me
to-morrow make artificial magnets of extraordinary
power). And let us take one of these
artificial magnets, and examine it, and see
where the power is in the mass, and whether it
is a dual power. You see it attracts these keys,
two or three in succession, and it will attract
a very large piece of iron. That, then, is a
very different thing indeed to what you saw
in the case of the shell-lac; for <i>that</i> only
attracted a light ball, but here I have several
ounces of iron held up. And if we come to
examine this attraction a little more closely,
we shall find it presents some other remarkable
differences: first of all, one end of this
bar (fig. 37) attracts this key, but the middle
does not attract. It is not, then, the <i>whole</i> of
the substance which attracts. If I place this
little key in the middle, it does not adhere; but
if I place it <i>there</i>, a little nearer the end, it
does, though feebly. Is it not, then, very
curious to find that there is an attractive power
at the extremities which is not in the middle&mdash;to
have thus in one bar two places in which
this force of attraction resides! If I take this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
bar and balance it carefully on a point, so that
it will be free to move round, I can try what
action this piece of iron has on it. Well, it
attracts one end, and it also attracts the other
end, just as you saw the shell-lac and the glass
did, with the exception of its not attracting in
the middle. But if now, instead of a piece of
iron, I take a <i>magnet</i>, and examine it in a
similar way, you see that one of its ends <i>repels</i>
the suspended magnet&mdash;the force then is no
longer attraction, but repulsion; but if I take
the other end of the magnet and bring it near,
it shews attraction again.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_037_038.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 37. and Fig. 38.</div>
</div>

<p>You will see this better, perhaps, by another
kind of experiment. Here (fig. 38) is a little
magnet, and I have coloured the ends differently,
so that you may distinguish one from the
other. Now this end (<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>) of the magnet (fig. 37)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
attracts the <i>uncoloured</i> end of the little magnet.
You see it pulls it towards it with great power;
and as I carry it round, the uncoloured end
still follows. But now, if I gradually bring
the middle of the bar magnet opposite the
uncoloured end of the needle, it has no effect
upon it, either of attraction or repulsion, until,
as I come to the opposite extremity (<span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>), you see
that it is the <i>coloured</i> end of the needle which is
pulled towards it. We are now therefore dealing
with two kinds of power, attracting different
ends of the magnet&mdash;a double power, already
existing in these bodies, which takes up the
form of attraction and repulsion. And now,
when I put up this label with the word
<span class="smcap lowercase">MAGNETISM</span>, you will understand that it is to
express this double power.</p>

<p>Now, with this loadstone you may make
magnets artificially. Here is an artificial magnet
(fig. 39) in which both ends have been
brought together in order to increase the attraction.
This mass will lift that lump of iron; and,
what is more, by placing this <i>keeper</i>, as it is
called, on the top of the magnet, and taking
hold of the handle, it will adhere sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
strongly to allow itself to be lifted up&mdash;so
wonderful is its power of attraction. If you
take a needle, and just draw one of its ends
along one extremity of the magnet, and then
draw the other end along the other extremity,
and then gently place it on the surface of some
water (the needle will generally float on the surface,
owing to the slight greasiness communicated
to it by the fingers), you will be able to get all
the phenomena of attraction and repulsion, by
bringing another magnetised needle near to it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_039.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 39.</div>
</div>

<p>I want you now to observe, that although I
have shewn you in these magnets that this
double power becomes evident principally at
the extremities, yet the <i>whole</i> of the magnet is
concerned in giving the power. That will at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
first seem rather strange; and I must therefore
shew you an experiment to prove that this is
not an accidental matter, but that the whole
of the mass is really concerned in this force,
just as in falling the whole of the mass is
acted upon by the force of gravitation. I have
here (fig. 40) a steel bar, and I am going to
make it a magnet, by rubbing it on the large
magnet (fig. 39). I have now made the two
ends magnetic in opposite ways. I do not at
present know one from the other, but we can
soon find out. You see when I bring it near
our magnetic needle (fig. 38) one end repels
and the other attracts; and the middle will
neither attract nor repel&mdash;it <i>cannot</i>, because it
is <i>half-way between the two ends</i>. But now,
if I break out that piece (<i>n s</i>), and then examine
it&mdash;see how strongly one end (<i>n</i>) pulls at this
end (<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span>, fig. 38), and how it repels the other end
(<span class="smcap lowercase">N</span>). And so it can be shewn that every part
of the magnet contains this power of attraction
and repulsion, but that the power is only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
rendered evident at the end of the mass. You
will understand all this in a little while; but
what you have now to consider is, that every
part of this steel is in itself a magnet. Here is
a little fragment which I have broken out of
the very centre of the bar, and you will still
see that one end is attractive and the other is
repulsive. Now, is not this power a most
wonderful thing? and very strange the means
of taking it from one substance and bringing
it to other matters? I cannot make a piece
of iron or anything else heavier or lighter than
it is. Its cohesive power it must and does have;
but, as you have seen by these experiments, we
can add or subtract this power of magnetism,
and almost do as we like with it.</p>

</div>

<p>And now we will return for a short time to
the subject treated of at the commencement of
this lecture. You see here (fig. 41) a large
machine, arranged for the purpose of rubbing
glass with silk, and for obtaining the power
called <i>electricity</i>; and the moment the handle
of the machine is turned, a certain amount of
electricity is evolved, as you will see by the rise
of the little straw indicator (at <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>). Now, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
know from the appearance of repulsion of the
pith ball at the end of the straw, that electricity
is present in those brass conductors (<span class="smcap lowercase">B B</span>), and I
want you to see the manner in which that
electricity can pass away. [Touching the conductor
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>) with his finger, the Lecturer drew a
spark from it, and the straw electrometer immediately
fell.] There, it has all gone; and that I
have really taken it away, you shall see by an
experiment of this sort. If I hold this cylinder
of brass by the glass handle, and touch the
conductor with it, I take away a little of the
electricity. You see the spark in which it
passes, and observe that the pith-ball indicator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
has fallen a little, which seems to imply that
so much electricity is lost; but it is not lost:
it is here in this brass; and I can take it away
and carry it about, not because it has any
substance of its own, but by some strange
property which we have not before met with
as belonging to any other force. Let us see
whether we have it here or not. [The Lecturer
brought the charged cylinder to a jet from
which gas was issuing; the spark was seen to
pass from the cylinder to the jet, but the gas
did not light.] Ah! the gas did not light, but
you saw the spark; there is, perhaps, some
draught in the room which blew the gas on
one side, or else it would light. We will try
this experiment afterwards. You see from the
spark that I can transfer the power from the
machine to this cylinder, and then carry it
away and give it to some other body. You
know very well, as a matter of experiment, that
we can transfer the power of heat from one
thing to another; for if I put my hand near
the fire it becomes hot. I can shew you this
by placing before us this ball, which has just
been brought red-hot from the fire. If I press<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
this wire to it, some of the heat will be transferred
from the ball; and I have only now to
touch this piece of gun-cotton with the hot
wire, and you see how I can transfer the heat
from the ball to the wire, and from the wire to
the cotton. So you see that some powers are
transferable, and others are not. Observe how
long the heat stops in this ball. I might touch
it with the wire, or with my finger, and if I
did so quickly, I should merely burn the surface
of the skin; whereas, if I touch that cylinder,
however rapidly, with my finger, the electricity
is gone at once&mdash;dispersed on the instant, in a
manner wonderful to think of.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 42.</div>
</div>

<p>I must now take up a little of your time in
shewing you the manner in which these powers
are transferred from one thing to another; for
the manner in which <i>force</i> may be conducted
or transmitted is extraordinary, and most essential
for us to understand. Let us see in what
manner these powers travel from place to place.
Both heat and electricity can be conducted; and
here is an arrangement I have made to shew
how the former can travel. It consists of a bar
of copper (fig. 42); and if I take a spirit-lamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
(this is one way of obtaining the power of heat),
and place it under that little chimney, the flame
will strike against the bar of copper and keep it
hot. Now, you are aware that power is being
transferred from the flame of that lamp to the
copper, and you will see by-and-by that it is
being conducted along the copper from particle
to particle; for, inasmuch as I have fastened
these wooden balls by a little wax at particular
distances from the point where the copper is
first heated, first one ball will fall, and then the
more distant ones, as the heat travels along&mdash;and
thus you will learn that the heat travels
gradually through the copper. You will see
that this is a very slow conduction of power, as
compared with electricity. If I take cylinders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
of wood and metal, joined together at the ends,
and wrap a piece of paper round, and then apply
the heat of this lamp to the place where the
metal and wood join, you will see how the heat
will accumulate where the wood is, and burn
the paper with which I have covered it; but
where the metal is beneath, the heat is conducted
away too fast for the paper to be burned.
And so, if I take a piece of wood and a piece of
metal joined together, and put it so that the
flame should play equally both upon one and
the other, we shall soon find that the metal
will become hot before the wood; for if I put a
piece of phosphorus on the wood, and another
piece on the copper, you will find that the
phosphorus on the copper will take fire before
that on the wood is melted&mdash;and this shews you
how badly the wood conducts heat. But with
regard to the travelling of electricity from place
to place, its rapidity is astonishing. I will, first
of all, take these pieces of glass and metal, and
you will soon understand how it is that the
glass does not lose the power which it acquired
when it is rubbed by the silk. By one or two
experiments I will shew you. If I take this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
piece of brass and bring it near the machine,
you see how the electricity leaves the latter,
and passes to the brass cylinder. And, again, if
I take a rod of metal and touch the machine
with it, I lower the indicator; but when I touch
it with a rod of glass, no power is drawn away,&mdash;shewing
you that the electricity is conducted
by the glass and the metal in a manner entirely
different: and to make you see that more
clearly, we will take one of our Leyden jars.
Now, I must not embarrass your minds with
this subject too much; but if I take a piece of
metal, and bring it against the knob at the top
and the metallic coating at the bottom, you will
see the electricity passing through the air as a
brilliant spark. It takes no sensible time to
pass through this; and if I were to take a long
metallic wire, no matter what the length&mdash;at
least as far as we are concerned&mdash;and if I make
one end of it touch the outside, and the other
touch the knob at the top, see how the electricity
passes!&mdash;it has flashed instantaneously
through the whole length of this wire. Is not
this different from the transmission of heat
through this copper bar (fig. 42), which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
taken a quarter of an hour or more to reach
the first ball?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_043.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 43.</div>
</div>

<p>Here is another experiment, for the purpose
of shewing the conductibility of this power
through some bodies, and not through others.
Why do I have this arrangement made of brass?
[pointing to the brass work of the electrical
machine, fig. 41]. Because it conducts electricity.
And why do I have these columns made
of glass? Because they obstruct the passage of
electricity. And why do I put that paper tassel
(fig. 43) at the top of the pole, upon a glass
rod, and connect it with this machine by means
of a wire? You see at once that as soon as the
handle of the machine is turned, the electricity
which is evolved travels along this wire and up
the wooden rod, and goes to the tassel at the
top, and you see the power of repulsion with
which it has endowed these strips of paper, each
spreading outwards to the ceiling and sides of
the room. The outside of that wire is covered
with gutta-percha. It would not serve to keep
the force from you when touching it with your
hands, because it would burst through; but it
answers our purpose for the present. And so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
you perceive how easily I can manage to send
this power of electricity from place to place, by
choosing the materials which can conduct the
power. Suppose I want to fire a portion of
gunpowder, I can readily do it by this transferable
power of electricity. I will take a Leyden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
jar, or any other arrangement which gives us
this power, and arrange wires so that they may
carry the power to the place I wish; and then
placing a little gunpowder on the extremities of
the wires, the moment I make the connection
by this discharging rod, I shall fire the gunpowder.
[The connection was made, and the
gunpowder ignited.] And if I were to shew
you a stool like this, and were to explain to you
its construction, you could easily understand
that we use glass legs, because these are capable
of preventing the electricity from going away to
the earth. If, therefore, I were to stand on this
stool, and receive the electricity through this
conductor, I could give it to anything that I
touched. [The Lecturer stood upon the insulating
stool, and placed himself in connection
with the conductor of the machine.] Now, I am
electrified&mdash;I can feel my hair rising up as the
paper tassel did just now. Let us see whether
I can succeed in lighting gas by touching the
jet with my finger. [The Lecturer brought his
finger near a jet from which gas was issuing,
when, after one or two attempts, the spark which
came from his finger to the jet set fire to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
gas.] You now see how it is that this power of
electricity can be transferred from the matter in
which it is generated, and conducted along
wires and other bodies, and thus be made to
serve new purposes utterly unattainable by the
powers we have spoken of on previous days;
and you will not now be at a loss to bring this
power of electricity into comparison with those
which we have previously examined; and to-morrow
we shall be able to go further into the
consideration of these transferable powers.</p>

<h2 title="THE CORRELATION OF THE PHYSICAL FORCES.">LECTURE VI.<br />

<small>THE CORRELATION OF THE PHYSICAL FORCES.</small></h2>


<p>We have frequently seen, during the course
of these lectures, that one of those
powers or forces of matter, of which I have
written the names on that board, has produced
results which are due to the action of some
other force. Thus, you have seen the force
of electricity acting in other ways than in attracting:
you have also seen it combine matters
together, or disunite them, by means of its action
on the chemical force; and in this case, therefore,
you have an instance in which these two
powers are related. But we have other and
deeper relations than these; we have not merely
to see how it is that one power affects another&mdash;how
the force of heat affects chemical affinity,
and so forth&mdash;but we must try and comprehend
what relation they bear to each other, and how
these powers may be changed one into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
other; and it will to-day require all my care,
and your care too, to make this clear to your
minds. I shall be obliged to confine myself
to one or two instances, because, to take in the
whole extent of this mutual relation and conversion
of forces, would surpass the human
intellect.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, here is a piece of fine
zinc-foil; and if I cut it into narrow strips and
apply to it the power of heat, admitting the
contact of air at the same time, you will find
that it burns; and then, seeing that it burns,
you will be prepared to say that there is
chemical action taking place. You see all I
have to do is to hold the piece of zinc at the
side of the flame, so as to let it get heated, and
yet to allow the air which is flowing into the
flame from all sides to have access to it;&mdash;there
is the piece of zinc burning just like a piece of
wood, only brighter. A part of the zinc is
going up into the air, in the form of that white
smoke, and part is falling down on to the table.
This, then, is the action of chemical affinity
exerted between the zinc and the oxygen of the
air. I will shew you what a curious kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
affinity this is by an experiment, which is rather
striking when seen for the first time. I have
here some iron filings and gunpowder, and will
mix them carefully together, with as little rough
handling as possible. Now, we will compare the
combustibility, so to speak, of the two. I will
pour some spirit of wine into a basin, and set it
on fire: and, having our flame, I will drop this
mixture of iron filings and gunpowder through
it, so that both sets of particles will have an
equal chance of burning. And now, tell me
which of them it is that burns? You see a
plentiful combustion of the iron-filings. But I
want you to observe that, though they have
equal chances of burning, we shall find that by
far the greater part of the gunpowder remains
untouched. I have only to drain off this spirit
of wine, and let the powder which has gone
through the flame dry, which it will do in a few
minutes, and I will then test it with a lighted
match. So ready is the iron to burn, that it
takes, under certain circumstances, even less
time to catch fire than gunpowder. [As soon as
the gunpowder was dry, Mr. Anderson handed
it to the Lecturer, who applied a lighted match<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
to it, when a sudden flash shewed how large a
proportion of gunpowder had escaped combustion
when falling through the flame of alcohol.]</p>

<p>These are all cases of chemical affinity; and I
shew them to make you understand that we
are about to enter upon the consideration of a
strange kind of chemical affinity, and then to see
how far we are enabled to convert this force of
affinity into electricity or magnetism, or any
other of the forces which we have discussed.
Here is some zinc (I keep to the metal zinc, as
it is very useful for our purpose), and I can
produce hydrogen gas by putting the zinc and
sulphuric acid together, as they are in that
retort. There you see the mixture which gives
us hydrogen&mdash;the zinc is pulling the water to
pieces and setting free hydrogen gas. Now,
we have learned by experience that, if a little
mercury is spread over that zinc, it does not
<i>take away</i> its power of decomposing the water,
but <i>modifies</i> it most curiously. See how that
mixture is now boiling; but when I add a little
mercury to it, the gas ceases to come off. We
have now scarcely a bubble of hydrogen set free,
so that the action is suspended for the time. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
have not <i>destroyed</i> the power of chemical affinity,
but modified it in a wonderful and beautiful
manner. Here are some pieces of zinc covered
with mercury, exactly in the same way as the
zinc in that retort is covered; and if I put this
plate into sulphuric acid, I get no gas&mdash;but this
most extraordinary thing occurs, that if I introduce
along with the zinc another metal which is
<i>not</i> so combustible, then I reproduce all the action.
I am now going to put to the amalgamated
zinc in this retort some portions of copper wire
(copper not being so combustible a metal as the
zinc), and observe how I get hydrogen again.
As in the first instance, there the bubbles are
coming over through the pneumatic trough, and
ascending faster and faster in the jar. The zinc
now is acting by reason of its contact with the
copper.</p>

<p>Every step we are now taking brings us to a
knowledge of new phenomena. That hydrogen
which you now see coming off so abundantly
does not come from the zinc, as it did before,
<i>but from the copper</i>. Here is a jar containing
a solution of copper. If I put a piece of this
amalgamated zinc into it, and leave it there, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
has scarcely any action; and here is a plate of
platinum, which I will immerse in the same
solution, and might leave it there for hours,
days, months, or even years, and no action
would take place. But by putting them both
together, and allowing them to touch (fig. 44),
you see what a coating of copper there is
immediately thrown down on the platinum.
Why is this? The platinum has no power of
itself to reduce that metal from that fluid, but it
has in some mysterious way received this power
by its contact with the metal zinc. Here, then,
you see a strange transfer of chemical force from
one metal to another&mdash;the chemical force from
the zinc is transferred, and made over to the
platinum by the mere association of the two
metals. I might take, instead of the platinum, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
piece of copper or of silver, and it would have
no action of its own on this solution; but the
moment the zinc was introduced and touched
the other metal, then the action would take
place, and it would become covered with copper.
Now, is not this most wonderful and beautiful
to see? We still have the identical chemical
force of the particles of zinc acting, and yet in
some strange manner we have power to make
that chemical force, or something it produces,
travel from one place to another&mdash;for we do
make the chemical force travel from the zinc to
the platinum by this very curious experiment of
using the two metals in the same fluid in contact
with each other.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_044_045.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 44. and Fig. 45.</div>
</div>

<p>Let us now examine these phenomena a little
more closely. Here is a drawing (fig. 45) in
which I have represented a vessel containing the
acid liquid, and the slips of zinc and platinum
or copper, and I have shewn them touching each
other <i>outside</i> by means of a wire coming from
each of them (for it matters not whether they
touch in the fluid or outside&mdash;by pieces of metal
attached&mdash;they still by that communication
between them have this power transferred from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
one to another). Now, if instead of only using
one vessel, as I have shewn there, I take
another, and another, and put in zinc and
platinum, zinc and platinum, zinc and platinum,
and connect the platinum of one vessel with the
zinc of another, the platinum of this vessel with
the zinc of that, and so on, we should only be
using a series of these vessels instead of one.
This we have done in that arrangement which
you see behind me. I am using what we call a
Grove’s voltaic battery, in which one metal is
zinc, and the other platinum, and I have as
many as forty pairs of these plates all exercising
their force at once in sending the whole amount
of chemical power there evolved through these
wires under the floor, and up to these two rods
coming through the table. We need do no
more than just bring these two ends in contact,
when the spark shews us what power is present;
and what a strange thing it is to see that this
force is brought away from the battery behind
me, and carried along through these wires. I
have here an apparatus (fig. 46) which Sir
Humphry Davy constructed many years ago, in
order to see whether this power from the voltaic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
battery caused bodies to attract each other in
the same manner as the ordinary electricity did.
He made it in order to experiment with his
large voltaic battery, which was the most powerful
then in existence. You see there are in this
glass jar two leaves of gold, which I can cause
to move to and fro by this rack-work. I will
connect each of these gold leaves with separate
ends of this battery; and, if I have a sufficient
number of plates in the battery, I shall be able
to shew you that there will be some attraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
between those leaves, even before they come in
contact. If I bring them sufficiently near when
they are in communication with the ends of the
battery, they will be drawn gently together; and
you will know when this takes place, because
the power will cause the gold leaves to burn
away, which they could only do when they
touched each other. Now, I am going to cause
these two leaves of gold to approach gradually,
and I have no doubt that some of you will see
that they approach before they burn; and those
who are too far off to see them approach will
see by their burning that they have come
together. Now they are attracting each other,
long before the connection is complete; and
there they go! burnt up in that brilliant flash&mdash;so
strong is the force. You thus see, from the
attractive force at the two ends of this battery,
that these are really and truly electrical phenomena.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_046_047.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 46. and Fig. 47.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, let us consider what is this spark. I
take these two ends and bring them together,
and there I get this glorious spark, like the
sunlight in the heavens above us. What is
this? It is the same thing which you saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
when I discharged the large electrical machine,
when you saw one single bright flash; it is
the same thing, only <i>continued</i>, because here we
have a more effective arrangement. Instead
of having a machine which we are obliged to
turn for a long time together, we have here a
<i>chemical</i> power which sends forth the spark;
and it is wonderful and beautiful to see how
this spark is carried about through these wires.
I want you to perceive, if possible, that this
very spark and the heat it produces (for there
is heat) is neither more nor less than the
chemical force of the zinc&mdash;its <i>very</i> force
carried along wires and conveyed to this place.
I am about to take a portion of the zinc and
burn it in oxygen gas, for the sake of shewing
you the kind of light produced by the actual
combustion in oxygen gas of some of this
metal. [A tassel of zinc-foil was ignited at a
spirit-lamp, and introduced into a jar of oxygen,
when it burnt with a brilliant light.] That
shews you what the affinity is when we come
to consider it in its energy and power. And
the zinc is being burned in the battery behind
me at a much more rapid rate than you see in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
that jar, because the zinc is there dissolving
and <i>burning</i>, and produces here this great
electric light. That very same power, which in
that jar you saw evolved from the actual combustion
of the zinc in oxygen, is carried along
these wires and made evident here; and you
may, if you please, consider that the zinc is
burning in those cells, and that <i>this</i> is the light
of that burning [bringing the two poles in contact,
and shewing the electric light]; and we
might so arrange our apparatus as to shew that
the amounts of power evolved in either case
are identical. Having thus obtained power
over the chemical force, how wonderfully we
are able to convey it from place to place!
When we use gunpowder for explosive purposes,
we can send into the mine chemical affinity by
means of this electricity; not having provided
fire beforehand, we can send it in at the
moment we require it. Now, here (fig. 47) is
a vessel containing two charcoal points, and I
bring it forward as an illustration of the wonderful
power of conveying this force from place
to place. I have merely to connect these by
means of wires to the opposite ends of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
battery, and bring the points in contact. See
what an exhibition of force we have! We
have exhausted the air so that the charcoal
cannot burn; and, therefore, the light you see is
really the burning of the zinc in the cells behind
me&mdash;there is no disappearance of the carbon,
although we have that glorious electric light;
and the moment I cut off the connection, it
stops. Here is a better instance to enable some
of you to see the certainty with which we can
convey this force, where, under ordinary circumstances,
chemical affinity would not act.
We may absolutely take these two charcoal
poles down under water, and get our electric
light there;&mdash;there they are in the water, and
you observe, when I bring them into connection,
we have the same light as we had in that glass
vessel.</p>

<p>Now, besides this production of light, we
have all the other effects and powers of burning
zinc. I have a few wires here which are
not combustible, and I am going to take one
of them, a small platinum wire, and suspend
it between these two rods, which are connected
with the battery; and, when contact is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
at the battery, see what heat we get (fig. 48).
Is not that beautiful?&mdash;it is a complete bridge
of power. There is metallic connection all the
way round in this arrangement; and where I
have inserted the platinum, which offers some
resistance to the passage of the force, you see
what an amount of heat is evolved,&mdash;this is
the heat which the zinc would give if burnt
in oxygen; but as it is being burnt in the
voltaic battery, it is giving it out at this spot.
I will now shorten this wire for the sake of
shewing you, that the shorter the obstructing
wire is, the more and more intense is the
heat, until at last our platinum is fused and
falls down, breaking off the circuit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_048.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 48.</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_049.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 49.]</div>
</div>

<p>Here is another instance. I will take a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
piece of the metal silver, and place it on charcoal,
connected with one end of the battery,
and lower the other charcoal pole on to it.
See how brilliantly it burns (fig. 49). Here is
a piece of iron on the charcoal&mdash;see what a
combustion is going on; and we might go on
in this way, burning almost everything we
place between the poles. Now, I want to shew
you that this power is still chemical affinity&mdash;that
if we call the power which is evolved at
this point <i>heat</i>, or <i>electricity</i>, or any other name
referring to its source, or the way in which it
travels, we still shall find it to be chemical
action. Here is a coloured liquid which can
shew by its change of colour the effects of
chemical action. I will pour part of it into
this glass, and you will find that these wires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
have a very strong action. I am not going to
shew you any effects of combustion or heat;
but I will take these two platinum plates, and
fasten one to the one pole, and the other to
the other end, and place them in this solution,
and in a very short time you will see the
blue colour will be entirely destroyed. See, it
is colourless now!&mdash;I have merely brought the
end of the wires into the solution of indigo,
and the power of electricity has come through
these wires, and made itself evident by its
chemical action. There is also another curious
thing to be noticed, now we are dealing with
the chemistry of electricity, which is, that the
chemical power which destroys the colour is
only due to the action on one side. I will
pour some more of this sulpho-indigotic acid<a id="FNanchor_23_24" href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">23</a>
into a flat dish, and will then make a porous
dyke of sand, separating the two portions of
fluid into two parts (fig. 50); and now we
shall be able to see whether there is any difference
in the two ends of the battery, and
which it is that possesses this peculiar action.
You see it is the one on my right hand which
has the power of destroying the blue&mdash;for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
portion on that side is thoroughly bleached&mdash;while
nothing has apparently occurred on the
other side. I say <i>apparently</i>, for you must not
imagine that, because you cannot perceive any
action, none has taken place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_050.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 50.</div>
</div>

<p>Here we have another instance of chemical
action. I take these platinum plates again, and
immerse them in this solution of copper, from
which we formerly precipitated some of the
metal, when the platinum and zinc were both
put in it together. You see that these two
platinum plates have no chemical action of
any kind&mdash;they might remain in the solution
as long as I liked, without having any power
of themselves to reduce the copper;&mdash;but the
moment I bring the two poles of the battery
in contact with them, the chemical action,
which is there transformed into electricity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
carried along the wires, again becomes chemical
action at the two platinum poles; and
now we shall have the power appearing on
the left-hand side, and throwing down the
copper in the metallic state on the platinum
plate; and in this way I might give you
many instances of the extraordinary way in
which this chemical action, or electricity, may
be carried about. That strange nugget of gold,
of which there is a model in the other room&mdash;and
which has an interest of its own in the
natural history of gold, and which came from
Ballarat, and was worth £8,000, or £9,000,
when it was melted down last November&mdash;was
brought together in the bowels of the earth,
perhaps ages and ages ago, by some such power
as this. And there is also another beautiful
result dependent upon chemical affinity in
that fine lead-tree<a id="FNanchor_24_25" href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">24</a>&mdash;the lead growing and
growing by virtue of this power. The lead
and the zinc are combined together in a little
voltaic arrangement, in a manner far more
important than the powerful one you see here;
because, in nature, these minute actions are
going on for ever, and are of great and won<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>derful
importance in the precipitation of metals
and formation of mineral veins, and so forth.
These actions are not for a limited time, like
my battery here, but they act for ever in
small degrees, accumulating more and more of
the results.</p>

<p>I have here given you all the illustrations
that time will permit me to shew you of
chemical affinity producing electricity, and electricity
again becoming chemical affinity. Let
that suffice for the present, and let us now go a
little deeper into the subject of this chemical
force, or this electricity&mdash;which shall I name
first&mdash;the one producing the other in a variety
of ways? These forces are also wonderful in
their power of producing another of the forces
we have been considering, namely, that of magnetism;
and you know that it is only of late
years, and long since I was born, that the discovery
of the relations of these two forces of
electricity and chemical affinity to produce
magnetism have become known. Philosophers
had been suspecting this affinity for a long
time, and had long had great hopes of success;
for in the pursuit of science we first start with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
hopes and expectations. These we realise and
establish, never again to be lost, and upon
them we found new expectations of further
discoveries, and so go on pursuing, realising,
establishing, and founding new hopes again and
again.</p>

<p>Now, observe this: here is a piece of wire
which I am about to make into a bridge of
force&mdash;that is to say, a communicator between
the two ends of the battery. It is copper wire
only, and is therefore not magnetic of itself. We
will examine this wire with our magnetic needle
(fig. 51); and though connected with one extreme
end of the battery, you see that, before
the circuit is completed, it has no power over
the magnet. But observe it when I make contact;
watch the needle&mdash;see how it is swung
round, and notice how indifferent it becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
if I break contact again; so you see we have
this wire evidently affecting the magnetic needle
under these circumstances. Let me shew you
that a little more strongly. I have here a
quantity of wire, which has been wound into a
spiral; and this will affect the magnetic needle
in a very curious manner, because, owing to its
shape, it will act very like a real magnet. The
copper spiral has no power over that magnetic
needle at present; but if I cause the electric
current to circulate through it, by bringing the
two ends of the battery in contact with the ends
of the wire which forms the spiral, what will
happen? Why, one end of the needle is most
powerfully drawn to it; and if I take the other
end of the needle, it is repelled: so you see I
have produced exactly the same phenomena
as I had with the bar magnet,&mdash;one end attracting,
and the other repelling. Is not this, then,
curious, to see that we can construct a magnet
of copper? Furthermore, if I take an iron bar,
and put it inside the coil, so long as there is
no electric current circulating round, it has no
attraction,&mdash;as you will observe if I bring a little
iron filings or nails near the iron. But now, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
I make contact with the battery, they are attracted
at once. It becomes at once a powerful
magnet&mdash;so much so, that I should not wonder
if these magnetic needles on different parts of
the table pointed to it. And I will shew you
by another experiment what an attraction it has.
This piece and that piece of iron, and many
other pieces, are now strongly attracted (fig. 52);
but as soon as I break contact, the power is all
gone, and they fall. What, then, can be a better
or a stronger proof than this of the relation of
the powers of magnetism and electricity? Again,
here is a little piece of iron which is not yet
magnetised. It will not at present take up
any one of these nails; but I will take a piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
of wire and coil it round the iron (the wire being
covered with cotton in every part, it does not
touch the iron), so that the current must go
round in this spiral coil. I am, in fact, preparing
an <i>electro-magnet</i> (we are obliged to use
such terms to express our meaning, because it
is a magnet made by electricity&mdash;because we
produce by the force of electricity a magnet of
far greater power than a permanent steel one).
It is now completed, and I will repeat the
experiment which you saw the other day, of
building up a bridge of iron nails. The contact
is now made, and the current is going through;
it is now a powerful magnet. Here are the iron
nails which we had the other day; and now I
have brought this magnet near them, they are
clinging so hard that I can scarcely move them
with my hand (fig. 53). But when the contact
is broken, see how they fall. What can shew
you better than such an experiment as this the
magnetic attraction with which we have endowed
these portions of iron? Here, again, is a
fine illustration of this strong power of magnetism.
It is a magnet of the same sort as the one you
have just seen. I am about to make the current<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
of electricity pass through the wires which are
round this iron for the purpose of shewing you
what powerful effects we get. Here are the
poles of the magnet; and let us place on one
of them this long bar of iron. You see, as soon
as contact is made, how it rises in position
(fig. 54); and if I take such a piece as this
cylinder, and place it on, woe be to me if I get
my finger between: I can roll it over, but if I
try to pull it off, I might lift up the whole
magnet; but I have no power to overcome the
magnetic power which is here evident. I might
give you an infinity of illustrations of this high
magnetic power. There is that long bar of iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
held out; and I have no doubt that, if I were to
examine the other end, I should find that it was
a magnet. See what power it must have to
support not only these nails but all those
lumps of iron hanging on to the end. What,
then, can surpass these evidences of the change
of chemical force into electricity, and electricity
into magnetism? I might shew you many
other experiments whereby I could obtain
electricity and chemical action, heat and light,
from a magnet; but what more need I shew
you to prove the universal correlation of the
physical forces of matter, and their mutual conversion
one into another?</p>

the respect we owe to our elders; and for a
time let me address myself to those of our
seniors who have honoured me with their presence
during these lectures. I wish to claim
this moment for the purpose of tendering our
thanks to them, and my thanks to you all,
for the way in which you have borne the inconvenience
that I at first subjected you to. I
hope that the insight which you have here
gained into some of the laws by which the
universe is governed, may be the occasion of
some amongst you turning your attention to these
subjects; for what study is there more fitted
to the mind of man than that of the physical
sciences? And what is there more capable of
giving him an insight into the actions of those
laws, a knowledge of which gives interest to the
most trifling phenomenon of nature, and makes
the observing student find&mdash;</p>

<small>LIGHT-HOUSE ILLUMINATION&mdash;THE ELECTRIC
LIGHT.</small></h2>


<p class="center">[<i>Delivered before the Royal Institution on Friday,
9th March, 1860.</i>]</p>


<p>There is no part of my life which gives
me more delight than my connection
with the Trinity House. The occupation of
nations joined together to guide the mariner
over the sea, to all a point of great interest,
is infinitely more so to those who are concerned
in the operations which they carry into
effect; and it certainly has astonished me, since
I have been connected with the Trinity House,
to see how beautifully and how wonderfully
shines forth amongst nations at large the desire
to do good; and you will not regret having
come here to-night, if you follow me in the
various attempts which have been made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
carry out the great object of guiding in safety
all people across the dark and dreary waste of
waters. It is wonderful to think how eagerly
efforts at improvement are made by the various
public bodies&mdash;the Trinity House in this country,
and Commissions in France and other nations;
and whilst the improvements progress, we come
to the knowledge of such curious difficulties, and
such odd modes of getting over those difficulties,
as are not easy to be conceived. I must ask
you this evening to follow me from the simplest
possible method of giving a sign by means of a
light to persons at a distance, to the modes at
which we have arrived in the present day; and
to consider the difficulties which arise when
carrying out these improvements to a practical
result, and the extraordinary care which those
who have to judge on these points must take
in order to guard against the too hasty adoption
of some fancied improvement, thus, as has
happened in some few cases, doing harm instead
of good.</p>

<p>If I try to make you understand these
things partly by old models, and partly by
those which we have here, it is only that I may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
the better be enabled to illustrate that which
I look forward to as the higher mode of
lighting, by means of the electric lamp and
the lime light.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_055.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 55.</div>
</div>

<p>There is nothing more simple than a candle
being set down in a cottage window to guide
a husband to his home; but when we want
to make a similar guide on a large scale,
not merely over a river or over a moor, but
over large expanses of sea, how can we then
make the signal, using only a candle? I
have shewn in this diagram (fig. 55) what we
may imagine to be the rays of a candle or
any other source of light emanating from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
centre of a sphere in all directions round to
infinite distances. After this simple kind of
light had been used for some time&mdash;it being
found to be liable to be obscured by fogs, or
distance, or other circumstance&mdash;there arose the
attempt to make larger lights by means of
fires; and after that there was introduced a
very important refinement in the mode of dealing
with the light, namely, the principle of
reflection,&mdash;for, understand this (which is not
known by all, and not known by many who
should know it), that when we take a source
of light&mdash;a single candle, for instance, giving off
any quantity of light&mdash;we can by no means
increase that light: we can make arrangements
around and about the light, as you see here,
but we can by no means <i>increase the quantity</i>
of light. The utmost I can do is to <i>direct</i>
the light which the lamp gives me by taking
a certain portion of the rays going off on one
side and reflecting them on to the course of
the rays which issue in the opposite direction.
First of all, let us consider how we may gather
in the rays of light which pass off from this
candle. You will easily see that if I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
take the half-rays on the one side, and could
send them by any contrivance over to the other
side, I should gain an advantage in light on the
side to which I directed them. This is effected
in a beautiful manner by the parabolic mirror,
by means of which I gather all that portion of
the rays which are included in it&mdash;upwards,
downwards, sideways, anywhere within its sphere
of action: they are all picked up and sent
forward. You thus see what a beautiful and
important invention is that of the parabolic
reflector for throwing forward the rays of
light.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_056.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 56.</div>
</div>

<p>Before I go further into the subject of
reflection, let me point out a further mode
of dealing with the direction of the light.
For instance, here is a candle, and I can employ
the principle of <i>refraction</i> to bend and direct
the rays of light; and if I want to increase the
light in any one direction, I must either take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
a reflector or use the principle of refraction. I
will place this lens (fig. 56) in front of the
candle, and you will easily see that by its means
I can throw on to that sheet of paper a great
light; that is to say, that instead of the light
being thrown all about, it is <i>refracted</i> and concentrated
on to that paper. So here I have
another means of bending the light and sending
it in one direction; and you see above a still
better arrangement for the same purpose,&mdash;one
which comes up to the maximum, I may say,
of the ability of directing light by this means.
You are aware that without that arrangement
of glass the light would be dispersed in all
directions; but the lens being there, all the
light which passes through it is thrown into
parallel beams and cast horizontally along.
There is consequently no loss of light&mdash;the
beam goes forward of the same dimensions, and
will consequently continue to go forward for
five or ten miles, or so long as the imperfection
of the atmosphere does not absorb it: and see,
what a glorious power that is, to be able to
convert what was just now darkness on that
paper into brilliant light!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>Whenever we have refraction of this sort, we
are liable to an evil consequent upon the
necessary imperfections in the form of the lens;
and Dr. Tyndall will take this lens, and will
shew you even in this small and perfect
apparatus what is the evil of spherical aberration
with which we have to fight. This can
be illustrated by means of the electric lamp: if
you look at the screen, you will see produced,
by means of this lens, a figure of the coal points.
This image is produced by the rays which pass
through the <i>middle</i> of the lens, a piece of card
with a hole in the centre being placed in front;
but if, keeping the rest of the apparatus in
the same position, I change this card for
another piece which will only allow the rays
to pass through the <i>edge</i> of the lens, you
observe how inferior the image will be. In
order to get it distinct, I have to bring the
screen much nearer the lamp; and so, if I take
the card away altogether, and allow the light
to pass through all parts of the lens, we cannot
get a perfect image, because the different parts
of the lens are not able to act together. This
spherical aberration is, therefore, what we try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
to avoid by building up compound lenses in
the manner here shewn (fig. 58). Look at this
beautiful apparatus&mdash;is it not a most charming
piece of workmanship? Buffon first, and Fresnel
afterwards, built up these kind of lenses, ring
within ring, each at its proper adjustment, to
compensate for the effects of spherical aberration.
The ring round that centre lens is ground
so as to obviate what would otherwise give rise
to spherical aberration; and the next ring being
corrected in the same manner, you will perceive,
if you look at the disc of light thrown by the
apparatus upstairs, that there is nothing like the
amount of aberration that there would have
been if it had been one great bull’s-eye. Here
is one of Fresnel’s lamps of the fourth order
so constructed (fig. 57): observe the fine effect
obtained by these different lenses, as you see
them revolve before you, and understand that
all this upper part is made to form part of
the lens, each prism throwing its rays to increase
the effect; and although you may think it is
imperfect, because, if you happen to sit below or
above the horizontal line, you perceive but little
if any of the light, yet you must bear in mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
that we want the rays to go in a straight line to
the horizon. So that all that building up of
rings of glass is for the purpose of producing one
fine and glorious lens of a large size, to send
the rays all in one direction. Here is another
apparatus used to pull the rays down to a
horizontal sheet of light, so that the mariner
may see it as a constant and uniform fixed
light. The former lamp is a revolving one,
and the light is seen only at certain times,
as the lenses move round, and these are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
points which make them valuable in their
application.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_057.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 57.</div>
</div>

<p>There are various orders and sizes of lights
in light-houses, to shine for twenty or thirty
miles over the sea, and to give indications
according to the purposes for which they are
required; but suppose we want more effect
than is produced by these means, how are
we to get more light? Here comes the difficulty.
We cannot get more light, because we
are limited by the condition of the burner.
In any of these cases, if the spreading of the
ray, or <i>divergence</i>, as it is called, is not restrained,
it soon fails from weakness; and if
it does not diverge at all, it makes the light
so small, that perhaps only one in a hundred
can see it at the same time. The South
Foreland light-house is, I think, 300 or 400
feet above the level of the sea; and therefore
it is necessary to have a certain divergence
of the beam of light, in order that it may
shine along the sea to the horizon. I have
drawn here two wedges&mdash;one has an angle of
15°, and shews you the manner in which the
light opens out from this reflector, seen at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
distance of half-a-mile or more; the other
wedge has an angle of 6°, which is the beautiful
angle of Fresnel. When the angle is less
than 6°, the mariner is not quite sure that he
will see the light&mdash;he may be beneath or
above it; and, in practice, it is found that
we cannot have a larger angle than 15°, or a
less one than 6°. In order, therefore, to get
more light, we must have more combustion,
more cotton, more oil; but already there are
in that lamp four wicks, put in concentric
rings, one within the other; and we cannot
increase them much more, owing to the divergence
which would be caused by an increase in
the size of the light&mdash;the more the divergence,
the more the light is diffused and lost. We
are therefore restrained, by the condition of
the light and the apparatus, to a certain sized
lamp. At Teignmouth, some of the revolving
lights have ten lamps and reflectors, all throwing
their light forward at once. But even
with ten lamps and reflectors, we do not get
sufficient light; and we want, therefore, a
means of getting a light more intense than a
candle in the space of a candle&mdash;not merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
an accumulation of candle upon candle, but a
concentration, into the space of a candle, of
a greater amount of light; and it is here that
the electric light comes to be of so much
value.</p>

<p>Let me now shew you what are the properties
of that light which make it useful for
light-house illumination, and which has been
brought to a practical condition by the energy
and constancy of Professor Holmes. I will,
first of all, shew you the image of the charcoal
points on the screen, and draw your
attention to the spot where the light is produced.
There are the coal points. The two
carbons are brought within a certain distance;
the electricity is being urged across by the
voltaic battery, and the coal points are brought
into an intense state of ignition. You will
observe that the light is essentially given by
the carbons. You see that one is much more
luminous than the other, and that is the end
which principally forms the spark. The other
does not shine so much, and there is a space
between the two, which, although not very
luminous, is most important to the production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
of the light. Dr. Tyndall will help me in
shewing you that a blast of wind will blow
out that light&mdash;the electric light can, in fact,
be blown out easier than a candle. We have
the power of getting our light where we
please. If I cause the electricity to pass between
carbon and mercury, I get a most
intense and beautiful light&mdash;most of it being
given off from the portion of the mercury
between the liquid and the solid pole. I can
shew you that the light is sometimes produced
by the vapour between the two poles better,
if I take silver, than when I use mercury.
Here is the carbon pole, there is the silver,
and there is the beautiful green light, which
comes from the intervening portions. Now,
that light is more easily blown out than the
common lamp, the slightest puff of wind
being sufficient to extinguish it, as you will
see if Dr. Tyndall breathes upon it.</p>

<p>You see, therefore, how we are able, by using
this electric spark, to get, first of all, the light
into a very small space. That oil-lamp has
a burner 3¾ inches in diameter. Compare the
size of the flame with the space occupied by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
this electric light. Next, compare the intensity
of this light with any other. If I take
this candle, and place it by the side, I actually
seem to put out the candle. We are thus
able to get a light which, while it surpasses
all others in brilliancy, is at the same time
not too large; for I might put this light into
an apparatus not larger than a hat, and yet
I could count upon the rays being useful.
Moreover, when such large burners are used in
a lantern, we have to consider whether the
bars of the window do not interfere to throw
a shadow or otherwise; but with this light
there will be no difficulty of that sort, as a
single small speculum, no larger than a hat,
will send it in any direction we please; and
it is wonderful what advantages, by reason of
its small bulk, we have in the consideration
of the different kinds of apparatus required,
reflecting or refracting, irrespective of other
reasons for using the electric light. And it is
these kind of things which make us decide
most earnestly and carefully in favour of the
electric light.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_058.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 58.</div>
</div>

<p>I am going to shew you the effect that will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
take place with that large lens, when we throw
the oil-lamp out of action, and put the electric
light into use. It is astonishing to find how
little the eye can compare the relative intensities
of two lights. Look at that screen, and
try to recollect the amount of light thrown
upon it from the 3¾ inch lamp of Fresnel;
and, now, when we shift the lens sideways,
look at the glorious light arising from that
small carbon point (fig. 58)&mdash;see how beautifully
it shines in the focus of that lens, and
throws the rays forward. At present, the
electric light is put at just the same distance
as the oil light; and therefore, being in the
focus of the lens, we have parallel rays which
are thrown forward in a perfectly straight line&mdash;as
you will see by comparing the size of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
the lens with that of the light thrown on the
screen. You will now see how far we can
affect this beam of light by increasing or
diminishing the distance of the lamp. We
are able, by a small adjustment, to get a
beam of a large or small angle; and observe
what power I have now over it,&mdash;for if I
want to increase the degrees of divergence, I
am limited by the power of light, in the case
of the oil-lamp; but, with the electric light,
I can make it spread over any width of the
horizon by this simple adjustment. These,
then, are some of the reasons which make it
desirable to employ the electric light.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_059.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 59.</div>
</div>

<p>By means of a magnet, and of motion, we
can get the same kind of electricity as I have
here from the battery; and, under the authority
of the Trinity House, Professor Holmes has
been occupied in introducing the magneto-electric
light in the light-house at the South
Foreland; for the voltaic battery has been
tried under every conceivable circumstance, and,
I take the liberty of saying, it has hitherto
proved a decided failure. Here, however, is
an instrument wrought only by mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
motion. The moment we give motion to this
soft iron in front of the magnet, we get a
spark. It is true, in this apparatus it is very
small, but it is sufficient for you to judge of
its character. It is the <i>magneto-electric</i> light;
and an instrument has been constructed, as
there shewn (fig. 59), which represents a number
of magnets placed radially upon a wheel&mdash;three
wheels of magnets and two sets of
helices. When the machine, which is worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
by a two-horse power engine, is properly set
in motion, and the different currents are all
brought together, and thrown by Professor
Holmes up into the lantern, we have a light
equal to the one we have been using this
evening. For the last six months the South
Foreland has been shining by means of this
electric light&mdash;beyond all comparison, better
than its former light. It has shone into France,
and has been seen there and taken notice of by
the authorities, who work with beautiful accord
with us in all these matters. Never for once
during six months has it failed in doing its
duty&mdash;never once&mdash;more than was expected by
the inventor. It has shone forth with its
own peculiar character, and this even with the
old apparatus; for, as yet, no attempt has
been made to construct special reflectors or
refractors for it, because it is not yet established.
I will not tell you that the problem
of employing the magneto-electric spark for
light-house illumination is quite solved yet,
although I desire it should be established
most earnestly (for I regard this magnetic
spark as one of my own offspring). The thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
is not yet decidedly accomplished, and what
the considerations of expense and other matters
may be, I cannot tell. I am only here
to tell you as a philosopher, how far the
results have been carried; but I do hope that
the authorities will find it a proper thing to
carry out in full. If it cannot be introduced
at all the light-houses&mdash;if it can only be used at
one&mdash;why, really, it will be an honour to the
nation which can originate such an improvement
as this&mdash;one which must of necessity
be followed by other nations.</p>

<p>You may ask, what is the use of this bright
light? It would not be useful to us, were it
not for the constant changes which are taking
place in the atmosphere, which is never pure.
Even when we can see the stars clearly on a
bright night, it is not a pure atmosphere. The
light of a light-house, more than any other, is
liable to be dimmed by vapours and fogs; and
where we most want this great power, is not in
the finest condition of the atmosphere, but
when the mariner is in danger&mdash;when the sleet
and rain are falling, and the fogs arise, and the
winds are blowing, and he is nearing coasts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
where the water is shallow, and abounds with
rocks,&mdash;then is his time of danger, when he
most wants this light. I am going to shew you
how, by means of a little steam, I can completely
obscure this glorious sun, this electric
light which you see. The cloud now obscuring
the light on the screen is only such a cloud
as you see when sitting in a train on a fine
summer’s day. You may observe that the vapour
passing out of the funnel casts as deep a shadow
on the ground as the black funnel; the very
sun itself is extinguished by the steam from the
funnel, so that it cannot give any light; and
the sun itself, if set in the light-house, would not
be able to penetrate such a vapour.</p>

<p>Now, the haze of this cloud of steam is just
what we have to overcome, and the electric
light is as soon, proportionally, extinguished
by an obstruction of this kind as any other
light. If we take two lights, one four times the
intensity of the other, and we extinguish half of
one by a vapour, we extinguish half of the
other&mdash;and that is a fact which cannot be set
aside by any arrangement. But, then, we fall
back upon the <i>amount</i> of light which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
electric spark does give us in aid of the power
of penetrating the fog; for the light of the electric
spark shines so far at times, that even
before it has arisen above the horizon, twenty-five
miles off, it can be seen. This intense light
has, therefore, that power which we can take
advantage of,&mdash;of bearing a great deal of obstruction,
before it is entirely obscured by fogs
or otherwise.</p>

<p>Taking care that we do not lead our authorities
into error by the advice given, we hope
that we shall soon be able to recommend the
Trinity House, from what has passed, to establish
either one or more good electric lights in
this country.</p>

Pages 23 and 24. <i>Power or Property in Water.</i>&mdash;This
power&mdash;the heat by which the water is kept in a
<i>fluid</i> state&mdash;is said, under ordinary circumstances, to be
<i>latent</i> or <i>insensible</i>. When, however, the water changes
its form, and, by uniting with the lime or sulphate of
copper, becomes <i>solid</i>, the heat which retained it in a
liquid state is evolved.</p></div>

Page 29. <i>Add a little liquid to the marble, and
decompose it.</i>&mdash;Marble is composed of <i>carbonic acid</i> and
<i>lime</i>, and, in chemical language, is called <i>carbonate of
lime</i>. When sulphuric acid is added to it, the carbonic
acid is set free, and the sulphuric acid unites with the
lime to form sulphate of lime.
</p>
<p>
<i>Carbonic acid</i>, under ordinary circumstances, is a
colourless invisible gas, about half as heavy again as
air. Dr. Faraday first shewed that, under great pressure,
it could be obtained in a liquid state. Thilorier,
a French chemist, afterwards found that it could be
solidified.</p></div>

Page 55. <i>Crystallisation of Alum.</i>&mdash;The solution
must be saturated&mdash;that is, it must contain as much alum
as can possibly be dissolved. In making the solution, it
is best to add powdered alum to hot water as long as it
dissolves; and when no more is taken up, allow the solution
to stand a few minutes, and then pour it off from the
dirt and undissolved alum.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8_9" href="#FNanchor_8_9" class="label">8</a>
Page 57. <i>Red Precipitate of Biniodide of Mercury.</i>&mdash;A
little care is necessary to obtain this precipitate. The
solution of potassium should be added to the solution
of perchloride of mercury (corrosive sublimate) very
gradually. The red precipitate which first falls is redissolved
when the liquid is stirred: when a little more
of the iodide of potassium is added, a pale, red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
precipitate is formed, which, on the further addition of the
iodide, changes into the brilliant scarlet biniodide of
mercury. If too much iodide of potassium is added, the
scarlet precipitate disappears, and a colourless solution
is left.</p></div>

be mixed with a little weak gum water, and then spread
over the paper, which must be dried without heat.
</p>
<p>
<i>Biniodide of Mercury</i> is said to be <i>dimorphous</i>; that is,
is able to assume two different forms.</p></div>

water. They were not, as is commonly supposed, invented
by Prince Rupert, but were first brought to England
by him, in 1660. They excited a great deal of

and a little water are added to some copper turnings.
It produces deep red fumes as soon as it comes in contact
with the air, by combining with the oxygen of the
latter to form hypo-nitrous acid. <i>Binoxide of nitrogen</i> is
composed of two parts oxygen and one part of nitrogen;
<i>hypo-nitrous acid</i> is composed of one part of nitrogen and
three parts of oxygen.</p></div>

of lead which has been heated in a glass tube to dull redness
as long as vapours are emitted. As soon as they
cease to be evolved, the end of the tube is sealed, and it
is allowed to cool.</p></div>

Page 115. <i>Paper Prepared like Gun-Cotton.</i>&mdash;It
should be bibulous paper, and must be soaked for ten
minutes in a mixture of ten parts by measure of oil of
vitriol with five parts of strong fuming nitric acid. The
paper must afterwards be thoroughly washed with warm
distilled water, and then carefully dried at a gentle heat.
The paper is then saturated with chlorate of strontia, or
chlorate of baryta, or nitrate of copper, by immersion in
a warm solution of these salts. (See <i>Chemical News</i>,
Vol. I., page 36.)</p></div>

Page 162. <i>Sulpho-indigotic Acid.</i>&mdash;A mixture of
one part of indigo and fifteen parts of concentrated oil of
vitriol. It is bleached on the side at which hydrogen
gas is evolved, in consequence of the liberated hydrogen
withdrawing oxygen from the indigo, thereby forming a
colourless deoxidised indigo. In making the experiment,
only enough of the sulpho-indigotic acid must be added to
give the water a decided blue colour.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24_25" href="#FNanchor_24_25" class="label">24</a>
Page 164. <i>Lead Tree.</i>&mdash;To make a lead tree, pass
a bundle of brass wires through the cork of a bottle, and
fasten a plate of zinc round them just as they issue from
the cork, so that the zinc may be in contact with every
one of the wires. Make the wires to diverge so as to
form a sort of cone, and having filled the bottle quite
full of a solution of sugar of lead, insert the wires and
cork, and seal it down, so as to perfectly exclude the
air. In a short time the metallic lead will begin to
crystallise around the divergent wires, and form a beautiful
object.</p></div>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  are located before using this ebook.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
